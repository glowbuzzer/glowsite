                                If you need guaranteed millisecond response times then you will need
                                to write C code in the software PLC layer. If you have a greater
                                degree of tolerance to your response times (e.g. 10ms) then you can
                                deploy code written in JavaScript or if you can cope with say 20ms
                                response times then you can have code in React responding.

                                of the glowbuzzer toolkit. EtherCAT is the primary fieldbus we
                                support. Mainly because of the wide range of drives and IO available
                                for it.

                                The glowbuzzer toolkit includes a software PLC but you can also
                                integrate with off-the-shelf PLCs. We can sit on an fieldbus network
                                either as a Master or Slave (with say the Hilscher netX) allowing
                                real-time communication with the PLC.
