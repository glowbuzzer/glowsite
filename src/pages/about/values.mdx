Two things excite &gb people:

* Working with modern software development tools and techniques
* Making machines do interesting and useful things

This needs an interesting blend of people with different skills and outlooks:
* Software developers interested in things like the latest web tech and real-time OS frameworks
* Automation professionals - interested in drives and machines and happy to get their hands dirty

Machine control is a difficult problem to solve which is why it is an area neglected by the massive changes in the software development that have occurred over the past 20 years.

Machine control is a different problem to that building a website. It needs top-to-bottom professionalism & rigour. It's got to work - all the time.

If you like modern software development and want to make machines do exciting things then you are also a &gb person.
