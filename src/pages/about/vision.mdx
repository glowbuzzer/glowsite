    <h2><i>Our vision is to make it easy to use web development technologies to build machine controls free of a dependency on proprietary hardware</i></h2>
</Card>

## What is our idea?
The idea of using modern software development tech to develop machine controls isn’t new:  every PLC and robot control will have been developed in C/C++ which was the "new tech" many decades ago.

But PLC and robot controls have not evolved quickly, the rest of the software world has left them far behind.

That have been attempts to address this. For example. Beckhoff’s TwinCAT vision, formed 20 years ago, of using blending Codesys with Microsoft development tools contains definite echoes of what we are doing.

But, TwinCAT is looking very old now against the explosion of web tech and “Windows C++ development” is now classed as a legacy technology in the software industry.

We do though, admire Beckhoff and our aim is to be ‘the Beckhoff of the web era’.

So, our idea is to deliver our customers a platform they can use to build machine controls of an industrially deployable nature using modern software tools, techniques and frameworks.
