# Our vision

<Tldr>
  - Get machines to market faster without writing firmware
  - Ready-to-deploy, embeddable control software with commercial support
  - Flexible HMI and integration options for production machines
  - Built for OEM production—not one-off or hobby machines
</Tldr>

## The market problem

- OEMs must develop or adapt control stacks for each model and variant—firmware, HMI, and integrations — slowing launches and eroding margin
- Open-source controllers like grbl and FluidNC are excellent for one-offs and hobby builds, but struggle with production-grade reliability, long-term support, and integration into factory software
- EtherCAT is popular for industrial machines but expensive and not easily embedded in a shippable product
- HMIs are often hard-coded and inflexible, making branding, customization, and multi-product reuse expensive
- Integrations with ERP and other systems such as vision require ad-hoc glue code that is hard to maintain

## What OEMs need

- A proven control core they can embed and ship
- Freedom to choose the components with the right price/performance for a given product — without major code rewrites
- A flexible, brandable HMI framework that can be adapted per product and customer
- Clean integration options (APIs, SDKs, network protocols) for line automation, analytics, and custom apps
- Commercial support, versioning, and a roadmap that matches product lifecycles

## Our solution

- Ready-to-deploy, embeddable real-time control software that removes firmware as a blocker
- React-based HMI framework with reusable widgets and layouts for fast, brandable machine UIs
- High-level APIs and language bindings for integrating with factory systems, vision, and custom logic—beyond G-code
- Hardware choice without code churn: support for cost-effective TMC steppers and EtherCAT servo drives
- File-based configuration and modular architecture to scale across models and options
- Commercial support, documentation, and a long-term roadmap

## Why it matters

- Ship sooner, scale faster, and support customers better — without building a control stack from scratch
- Reuse software and HMIs across product lines while keeping room for customer-specific adaptations
- Focus engineering effort on machine design and process know‑how, not infrastructure
