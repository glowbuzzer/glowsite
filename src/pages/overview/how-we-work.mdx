OEMs engage with us in two typical scenarios:

- *New machine development*: building control software from the ground up
- *Software replacement*: modernizing or replacing outdated control systems

We often get involved early in the product development cycle, helping with feasibility, budgeting, and business case development. From there, we either work as an integrated part of your engineering team or take full responsibility for the software stack.
We support the complete software lifecycleâ€”from prototyping and testing to deployment and long-term maintenance.
