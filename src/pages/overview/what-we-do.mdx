We provide a software toolkit for building real-time control systems and simulations for industrial robots and complex machines. Our software is designed to be seamlessly embedded into the machine, making it feel like a native part of the product.

We work exclusively with OEMsâ€”companies that manufacture machines at scale for end customers. These OEMs need robust, customizable control software that can be deeply integrated and branded as their own.
The types of machines we support are diverse, including:

- 6-DOF robot arms including Cobots and FSoE
- Cartesian packing machines
- Laboratory automation systems
- Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) with integrated manipulators
- CNC tube bending machines

...and many other complex systems.
