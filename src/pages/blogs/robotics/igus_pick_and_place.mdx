## Introduction

This blog discusses how to use an Igus D-DOF robot arm to perform simple pick and place operations with the &gbt.

## Hardware

We are using an Igus 5-DOF arm. This is a "kit" produced by igus.

We used Oriental Motor Stepper motors on the robot. These have absolute encoders which removes the need for any homing cycles or limit switches and much simplifies construction.

The motor models used on the different joints are as follows:

* Joint 1 - AZM69
* Joint 2 - AZM69
* Joint 3 - AZM48
* Joint 4 - AZM48
* Joint 5 - AZM26

Controllers:

* AZD-3A - 3 axis Oriental Motors EtherCAT
* AZD-2A - 2 axis Oriental Motors EtherCAT


Beckhoff IO was provided for:

* EK1100 - Coupler
* EL2022 - 2 x digital out - 2A (for pneumatic valve actuator for sucker)
* EL2008 - 8 x digital out
* EL1008 - 8 x digital in

The wired control panel is shown in the following photograph.

## Mechanical construction

## Kinematics

A 5-DOF arm, unlike their 6-DOF friends, have a large number of unreachable positions and orientations in their working space.

This means that you can not specify an arbitrary position and orientation within the robots reach and expect it to be able to reach it.

With the Igus all positions (excluding those around the base and out of reach) can be attained it is just there are constraints on the orientations that can be achieved at each position.
