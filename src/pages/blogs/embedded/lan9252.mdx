# Getting the Microchip LAN9252/53 working with glowbuzzer toolkit

## Introduction

<TitleImage image={lan9252} alt="LAN9252"/>

This blog describes the process of getting the Microchip LAN9252/52 EtherCAT slave controller working with the glowbuzzer toolkit.

The LAN9252 and the newer LAN9253 are Microchipâ€™s 2/3-port EtherCAT device controller (ESC) with dual integrated Ethernet PHYs.

It is available in an easy to prototype 64-TQFP or 64-QFN package.

It is a simple chip, with a simple interface requiring simple software to drive it. This is a combination we find very appealing.

Hardware design is very simple with a low BoM count:
* An external crystal of MEMs oscillation
* PSU filtering & decoupling
* Dual magnetics
* EEPROM

There are easy options to prototype with the LAN9252 - (Microchip dev board or EasyCAT) provide details here?
