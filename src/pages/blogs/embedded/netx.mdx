This blog describes the process of getting the Hilscher netX 51 Network controller for fieldbus and Real-Time Ethernet slaves working with the &gbt.


Hilscher produce a range of real time fieldbus communication chips.

The series we work with primarily are the <Text mark>NETX51/52</Text>.


There are available as a SoM or more complete modules or discrete ICs in a PBGA, with a 1 mm raster and 244 Pins. The SoM delivers a very low BoM count - just connectors and leds and a couple of filtering capacitors.

The Hilscher NETX presents an SPI interface with which we can integrate with &gbc. Over this SPI interface we can exchange the process data image from &gbc to the NETX which then exchanges it with the  fieldbus master. The NETX supports multiple industrial Ethernet protocols (see above). This enables &gbc to interoperate in the embedded environment

Options to easily prototype with the NETX such as the NETshield.
