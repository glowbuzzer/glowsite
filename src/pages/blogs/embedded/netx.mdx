This blog describes the process of getting the Hilscher netX 51 Network controller for fieldbus and Real-Time Ethernet slaves working with the glowbuzzer toolkit


Hilscher produce a range of real time fieldbus communication chips.

The series we work with primarily are the <Text mark>NETX51/52</Text>.


There are available as a SoM or more complete modules or discrete ICs in a PBGA, with a 1 mm raster and 244 Pins. The SoM delivers a very low BoM count - just connectors and leds and a couple of filtering capacitors.

The Hilscher NETX presents an SPI interface with which we can integrate with GBC. Over this SPI interface we can exchange the process data image from GBC to the NETX which then exchanges it with the  fieldbus master. The NETX supports multiple industrial Ethernet protocols (see above). This enables GBC to interoperate in the embedded environment

Options to easily prototype with the NETX such as the NETshield.
