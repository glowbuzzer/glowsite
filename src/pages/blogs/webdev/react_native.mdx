## Introduction

<TitleImage image={reactIcon} alt="React logo"/>

React Native describes itself as "combining the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class
JavaScript library for building user interfaces".

React Native allows you to build native applications for Android and iOS using React.

This is interesting to us as it allows a way to use the &gbt to build HMI (user interface) applications to control
machines that can can be deployed to tablets, phones or industrial HMIs running Android.

This blog post describes how to use the &gbr components with React Native.

## Expo

[Expo](https://expo.dev) is a set of tools and services built around React Native that streamline the development process and allow you to
get a React Native app up and running on your phone within minutes.

This tutorial makes use of Expo to simplify the setup, but you do not have to use Expo for your React Native app.

## Is React Native the right choice for my app?

This tutorial shows how to build a React Native app using the &gbt. React Native apps are not built using HTML and CSS and
the user interface needs to be carefully constructed using React Native features. These are then rendered using the native
controls on each device. This has pros and cons, and other options are available. For example, you might consider creating a
progressive web app (PWA) using frameworks such as [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com). This bundles an app in a native
container but uses a WebView under the covers to render your vanilla React app (HTML and CSS).

## Glowbuzzer Controls and Glowbuzzer Store

The &gbt is split into two core dependencies `@glowbuzzer/store` and `@glowbuzzer/controls`. The controls are vanilla
React components written in HTML and CSS, and as such they cannot be used in your React Native app. The store, on the other hand,
uses Redux which works just fine in React Native. This also provides useful hooks and a motion API making it easy to interact with
&gbc.

## Project setup

The code for the finished app is [available on Github](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/tree/main/examples/react-native).

First create a new Expo project [using the instructions on the Expo site](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app).

Check that you are able to connect to the new app on your phone.

Next add the dependencies for &gb and react-redux:
```
npm install --save @glowbuzzer/store react-redux
```

Now you can create a component that lets you connect to &gbc. Create the file `SimpleConnectView.jsx`.

```jsx
// SimpleConnectView.jsx
import { Button, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native"
import {
    DesiredState,
    determine_machine_state,
    FaultCode,
    MachineState,
    possible_transitions,
    useConnection,
    useMachine
} from "@glowbuzzer/store"

// CHANGE THE CONNECT URL WITH ADDRESS WHERE GBC IS RUNNING
const CONNECT_URL = "ws://192.168.1.199:9001/ws"

export const SimpleConnectView = () => {
    const connection = useConnection()
    const machine = useMachine()

    const state = determine_machine_state(machine.statusWord)

    // some variables we will use based on current connection and machine state
    const connected = connection.connected && connection.statusReceived
    const fault = machine.currentState === MachineState.FAULT
    const fault_active = machine.currentState === MachineState.FAULT_REACTION_ACTIVE
    const target_not_acquired = machine.actualTarget !== machine.requestedTarget
    const op_enabled = !(!connected || fault || fault_active || target_not_acquired)

    return (
        <View>
            <Text>Connection state: {connection.state}</Text>
            <View>
                <Text>
                    {connection.connected ? (
                        <Button title={"DISCONNECT"} onPress={() => connection.disconnect()} />
                    ) : (
                        <Button title={"CONNECT"} onPress={() => connection.connect(CONNECT_URL)} />
                    )}
                </Text>
            </View>
        </View>
    )
}
```

In order to render this component, you need to bootstrap the Redux store and add the component to your app. Edit `App.jsx` as follows.

```jsx
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import { Provider } from "react-redux"
import { rootReducer } from "@glowbuzzer/store"
import { SimpleConnectView } from "./SimpleConnectView"

const style = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: "#fff",
        alignItems: "center",
        justifyContent: "center"
    }
})

export default function App() {
    // middleware factory
    const middleware = getDefault => {
        return getDefault({ immutableCheck: false, serializableCheck: false })
    }

    // create the Redux store
    const store = configureStore({
        reducer: rootReducer,
        middleware
    })

    return (
        <Provider store={store}>
            <View style={style.container}>
                <SimpleConnectView />
                <StatusBar style="auto" />
            </View>
        </Provider>
    )
}
```

Run &gbc and bring up the app on your phone with Expo app. To run &gbc, use the generic config:
```shell
gbc --config config_generic.json
```

Check that you can connect and disconnect to &gbc from the app.

After connecting &gbr to &gbc, you need a way to clear faults and enable operation before you can issue moves.

Add the following code to allow clearing of faults:

```jsx
    return (
        <View>
            ... existing code ...

            {connected && fault && (
                <Button
                    onPress={() =>
                        machine.setMachineControlWord(possible_transitions.FaultReset())
                    }
                    title={"Reset Fault"}
                />
            )}
        </View>
    )
```

The following code provides buttons to disable and enable operation:

```jsx
    return (
        <View>
            ... existing code ...

            <View>
                <View>
                    <Text>Machine operation</Text>
                </View>
                <Button
                    disabled={!op_enabled}
                    onPress={() => machine.setDesiredState(DesiredState.STANDBY)}
                    color={state === MachineState.OPERATION_ENABLED ? "gray" : undefined}
                    title={"Disabled"}
                />
                <Button
                    disabled={!op_enabled}
                    onPress={() => machine.setDesiredState(DesiredState.OPERATIONAL)}
                    color={state === MachineState.OPERATION_ENABLED ? undefined : "gray"}
                    title={"Enabled"}
                />
            </View>
        </View>
    )
```

Finally, you need to add some components to send moves to &gbc.

Create a new file `SimpleMoveView.jsx`:

```jsx
import { useJointPositions, useSoloActivity } from "@glowbuzzer/store"
import { Button, Text, View } from "react-native"

export const SimpleMoveView = () => {
    const joints = useJointPositions(0)
    const api = useSoloActivity(0)

    function move(n) {
        return api.moveJoints([n]).relative(true).promise()
    }

    return (
        <View>
            <View>
                <Text>Position: {joints[0]}</Text>
            </View>
            <View>
                <Button title={"Move -100"} onPress={() => move(-100)} />
                <Button title={"Move +100"} onPress={() => move(+100)} />
            </View>
        </View>
    )
}
```

Add this component to `App.jsx` and test that you can move a joint.

Congratulations, you have successfully created a React Native glowbuzzer application!
