## Introduction

<TitleImage image={three_logo} alt="Three.js logo"/>

three.js is a JavaScript library used to create and display 3D graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

three.js is used within the &gbt for the 3D display of robots and toolpaths.


## Code

The code that accompanies this blog post can be found at:

<GitHubLink title={"three.js tutorial"} repo={"gbr"} directory={"/examples/three-tutorial"}/>

If you clone the repository and run `pnpm i` in the `/gbr` directory and then in this same directory run `vite examples/three-tutorial` you will see the three-tutorial examples.

## The &gbt 3D scene tile

The toolkit contains a 3D scene tile. This tile displays robot models and traces the toolpath the machine will follow.

If you jog your machine, you will see the movement in the 3D scene tile.

If you load gcode, you will see the expected (future) ToolPath in the tile.

The 3D Scene Tile is the three.js canvas which we can customise in different ways. For example, we can:

* create 3D models of custom kinematics configurations (different types of robots) and visualise their movement
* add our own objects to the scene and use their positions to help develop robot programs
* add CAD models (e.g. a STEP file) to the scene and use their geometry to develop robot programs
* add animations of the robot interacting with objects in the scene


### three.js basics

React 3 Fibre (R3F) is described as a "React renderer for three.js on the web and react-native".

This means it is responsible for rendering React components to the DOM and native views which means we are able to create regular React components and let react-three-fiber handle converting those components into three.js primitives (3D objects).

As the &gbt is based on React, we primarily interact with three.js through React 3 Fibre. So, most of the code in this blog (and in the &gbt) will be interactions with three.js through R3F.

Another package that we use is [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) which contains a range of useful helpers for R3F. These include:

- controls - for example `FlyControls`, `TrackballControls` which enabled you to navigate your scene in different ways
- shortcuts - which allow you to more easily create Shapes such as `Line` `Cube` etc.
- gizmos - for example `PivotControls` which allow you to move objects within the scene
- loaders - for example `usGLTF` which allows you to load GLTF files

Some basic three terminology to get us started:

**scene**
 : it where everything takes place visually. In other words, it is your x, y, z 3D space.

**camera**
: how your scene is observed different types of camera (e.g. perspective, orthographic)

**light**
: scenes are dark until you add, well, a light. Ambient light comes from all directions, directional light comes from one side, point light comes from a particular point, and spotlight is, well, like a real world spotlight

**mesh**
: is what we place into our scene at a specific coordinate. It accepts a geometry to specify the shape of your object, a material for surface level effects, and it allows for the attachment of event handlers so that you can interact with it.

**geometry**
: is how specific shapes are assigned to the mesh in your scene. A sphere, box, cone, and cylinder are only a handful of the geometry objects

**material**
: is what is applied to the outer surface of your mesh. Choosing basic, lambert, phong, or normal will all affect how light interacts with your object:

- `meshLambertMaterial` - for non-shiny surfaces, without specular highlights.
- `meshBasicMaterial` - for drawing geometries in a simple shaded (flat or wireframe) way.
- `meshStandardMaterial` - physically based material, using Metallic-Roughness workflow.
- `MeshPhongMaterial` - for shiny surfaces with specular highlights.
- there are others material types - see [the three docs](https://threejs.org/docs/)

**shadows**
: lights (spot and point but not ambient) can cast shadows onto a mesh that is configured to receive them

### canvas object

The 3D Scene tile  provides the R3F Canvas object. (they describe the canvas object as  your "portal into three.js" which is a fancy way of saying it provides your three.js scene and camera.

The Canvas object is where you start to define your React Three Fiber Scene.

### Adding objects to the scene

In your &gbr `App` function you will render the tiles used in your application. One of them will be the `threeDimensionalSceneTile`.

To add R3F components into the scene you simply add them as follows:

```js
<threeDimensionalSceneTile model={TX40_MODEL}>
    <MyComponent/>
</threeDimensionalSceneTile>
```

### Example 1 - Adding a Sphere to the scene

The code for this example is in the `ExampleSphere` function in `exampleSphere.tsx` in the gbr repository in the `examples` directory.

To add a sphere geometry to your scene, three.js has a class `SphereGeometry` for generating these. The drei utilies provides a shortcut to add these, we will use their `Sphere` shortcut here.

Using this is straightforward, as can be seen in the following code:

```js
import {
    Sphere,
} from "@react-three/drei"


const ExampleSphere = () => {
    return (
        <Sphere args={20}
            position={[300, 300, 0]}
        >
            <meshBasicMaterial color="red"/>
        </Sphere>
    )
}
```

`postion` is the position of the sphere within the scene.

`args` map to the constructor arguments on the Sphere geometry and here specify the radius of the sphere.

`meshBasicMaterial` is the material to be used for the sphere. Here we will use the most basic "plain flat" material.

`color` is the color of the sphere mesh. Here we have used red.

In terms of the `args`. Looking at the three.js documentation we see how they map to the constructor arguments:

**`SphereGeometry(radius : Float, widthSegments : Integer, heightSegments : Integer, phiStart : Float, phiLength : Float, thetaStart : Float, thetaLength : Float)`**

* **radius** — sphere radius. Default is 1.
* **widthSegments** — number of horizontal segments. Minimum value is 3, and the default is 32.
* **heightSegments** — number of vertical segments. Minimum value is 2, and the default is 16.
* **phiStart** — specify horizontal starting angle. Default is 0.
* **phiLength** — specify horizontal sweep angle size. Default is Math.PI * 2.
* **thetaStart** — specify vertical starting angle. Default is 0.
* **thetaLength** — specify vertical sweep angle size. Default is Math.PI.

So the `args={20}` code specifies the radius of the sphere and the rest of the constructor arguments are defaults.

screenshotExampleSphere

In this example, we used `meshBasicMaterial` which is just a simple shaded material. Try varying the material to `meshLambertMaterial`, `meshStandardMaterial` & `MeshPhongMaterial` and zoom in and see what difference it makes.

Also try varying the parameters of the materials. E.g. `<meshPhongMaterial transparent={true} color="red" opacity={0.5}/>` will give a semi-transparent sphere.

### Example 2 - Add some texture to a box geometry and make it move

The code for this example is in the `ExampleTexture` function in `exampleTexture.tsx` in the gbr repository in the `examples` directory.

We have grabbed a metal texture from (AmbientCG)[https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Metal024]. This is a rusty metal texture and the files we downloaded are in the `/examples/textures` directory.

First, we want to apply this to a box geometry. This is done by passing `props` to `<meshStandard material/>` as shown below:

```js
        const props = useTexture({
            metalnessMap: "/textures/Metal024/Metal024_1K_Metalness.jpg",
            map: "/textures/Metal024/Metal024_1K_Color.jpg",
            roughnessMap: "/textures/Metal024/Metal024_1K_Roughness.jpg",
            normalMap: "/textures/Metal024/Metal024_1K_NormalGL.jpg"
        })
```
```js
<Box ref={boxRef} args={[200,200,200]} position={[0, 300, 0]}  castShadow={true}>
    <meshStandardMaterial {...props}/>
</Box>
```
Next, we want to make the cube move.

`useFrame` is a R3F hook that calls you back every frame. This is good for making things move, updating properties etc.
`clock` is the `THREE.clock` system clock which you can `.start`, `.stop` etc.

```js
        useFrame(({clock}) => {
            boxRef.current.rotation.x = (Math.sin(clock.elapsedTime) * Math.PI) / 4
            boxRef.current.rotation.y = (Math.sin(clock.elapsedTime) * Math.PI) / 4
            boxRef.current.rotation.z = (Math.sin(clock.elapsedTime) * Math.PI) / 4
            boxRef.current.position.x = 400
            boxRef.current.position.y = Math.sin(clock.elapsedTime) * 300
            boxRef.current.position.z = Math.sin(clock.elapsedTime) + 200
        })
````

        `const boxRef = useRef(null)`

If working outside of the &gbt codebase, the most basic three.js example would be:

```js
import { Canvas, useFrame } from 'react-three-fiber'

```
