    - Different tiers support different response times
    - Can place user code in all tiers
    - Response times vary by tier - 1ms -> 100ms
    - React layer is least responsive
</Tldr>
How can a React app running in the browser or on a desktop handle the 1ms responses times needed by industrial control applications?

The simple answer is that it canâ€™t, but we solve this limitation using a tiered architecture offering different responsiveness at each tier.

Standard desktop operating systems running a React application are subject to garbage collection (GC) and other pauses due to background processes,
which means your React control application cannot always respond to events occurring on the machine in real-time.

We allow deployment of code into four distinct tiers as described below. Important activities that need a 1ms response time are not handled in the React
application but much of the complex control logic and workflow can be. This provides a flexible and rapid development environment for most of your application, while still
allowing time critical functions to be deployed where they are needed.

<div>
    <Row>
        <Col lg={18} xs={24} style={{background: '#b37feb', padding: '5px 5px'}}>
            ## Tier 1
            ### React application
            **Response time between 10 milliseconds & 1 second (usually fast as PCs are generally very quick but this is
            not guaranteed)**
        </Col>
    </Row>
    <Row>
        <Col lg={18} xs={24} style={{background: '#d3adf7', padding: '5px 5px'}}>
            ## Tier 2
            ### Javascript code running inside the real-time control (&gbc)
            **Response time around 5 milliseconds**
        </Col>
    </Row>
    <Row>
        <Col lg={18} xs={24} style={{background: '#efdbff', padding: '5px 5px'}}>
            ## Tier 3
            ### C code hooked into the real-time control (&gbc)
            **Response time guaranteed to be your cycle time (4 milliseconds down to 0.5 milliseconds)**
        </Col>
    </Row>
    <Row>
        <Col lg={18} xs={24} style={{background: '#f9f0ff', padding: '5px 5px'}}>
            ## Tier 4
            ### C code running in &gbeml or &gbeml
            **Response time guaranteed to be your cycle time (4 milliseconds down to 0.5 milliseconds)**
        </Col>
    </Row>
</div>

You should architect your application carefully based on the response time needed to make sure code runs in the right tier. Usually 99% of the code lives in Tier 1 and only small specialised functions live in the other tiers.

Privileged functions like estop live down in Tiers 3 and 4 whereas the function to enable the machine for initial use lives in Tier 1.
