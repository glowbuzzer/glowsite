## &gbrl

The front-end is a set of react components called GBR. The React components can run in web browsers or with React Native on Android/IoS or Windows/macOS (or Electron).

This means the &gbr components can be deployed on a range of devices either in the browser or natively - Windows PCs, Macs, Tablets, Phones, different HMIs.

## &gbcl

The core control is written in vanilla C and is highly portable.

The core supported platforms are real-time Linux and embedded STM32 but no issues are likely to be found deploying on platforms such as VxWorks, QNX, Xenomai or different high-end dual-core (cortex M4/M7) microcontrollers running FreeRTOS.

The core control is highly performant. For example, the Raspberry 4 single board computer supports six axis robots at with 1 millisecond cycle time to the drives.

If you are using the &gbt with Linux (rather than running on an embedded microcontroller) you will need either an industrial PC or an embedded Linux platform.

Industrial PCs come in two flavours:
* Traditional PC with for example a Mini ATX mother board and an Intel/AMD processor in an industrial enclosure
* (usually) an ARM based SoC delivered in either in an SBC (single board computer) format or SoM/CoM on a modules plugged or soldered onto a carrier board


Embedded Linux solutions are usually ARM SoC based platforms. In this area, we work with Toradex (www.toradex.com) but there are many other vendors. For prototyping all our code works on the Raspberry Pi.

To use either option will require multiple Ethernet ports or Ethernet+Wi-Fi. One Ethernet port will be devoted to EtherCAT traffic and the other to communicating over websockets to the React front-end software.

&gbc runs on low-end hardware but needs multiple cores. The lowest specification we would recommend would be a quad-core running at 1+ GHz and having 1+ GB of RAM.

## (&gbem/&gbsm)

&gbem and &gbsm (the EtherCAT master and stepper motor IC control components) run on Linux or on a microcontroller.

These interfaces with &gbc over shared memory on Linux or through SPI on embedded platforms.

The required interfaces vary by platform/function:

Linux EtherCAT/Step master

: Requires access to the POSIX shared memory API which allows processes to communicate information by sharing a region of memory. This is available across a wide variety of different Linux platforms

Linux EtherCAT master

: Requires a RAW sockets network interface again this is widely available

Linux Step master

: Requires a GPIO/SPI interface. Linux has spidev and libgpiod and we often use these interfaces but on some variants of Linux (.e.g Raspberry Pi) other libraries are needed

Microcontroller EtherCAT/Step master

: Requires a GPIO / SPI interface. Microcontrollers are pretty good at GPIO and SPI so this is not an issue!

Microcontroller EtherCAT master

: Requires a custom network driver. We have ported this to STM32/lwIP but for different microcontrollers using different middleware porting work would be needed
