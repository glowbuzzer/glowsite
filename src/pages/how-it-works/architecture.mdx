<Tldr>
    - Multiple components in the toolkit
    - Layer 1 (&gbr) - React components
    - Layer 2 (&gbc)- Real-time control
    - Layer 3 (&gbem/&gbsm)- Drives & IO interface
</Tldr>

The &gbt is structured as three layers.
Each layer is a separate software component in the &gbt. At the lowest layer you will use either &gbeml or &gbsml depending on how you want to interact with drives and IO.

{/*
**LAYER1**

: The front-end React components used to build the user interface and machine control logic

**LAYER2**

: The real-time core control

**LAYER3**

: The interface to drives and IO

        ## Integrating with a fieldbus

        When you want to integrate with EtherCAT drives and IO, you use &gbem which is an EtherCAT master. This talks to
        &gbc the real-time control and to the EtherCAT network itself.

        ## Integrating with a motor driver ICs

        When you want to integrate with motor driver ICs (usually in an embedded environment) you used &gbsm which talks
        over SPI to common motor driver ICs.

## LAYER 1 - &gbrl

We supply a comprehensive set of components to perform the fundamental machine control functions. Some examples of these components include:

<GbrTilesOverview/>

These components are all published under an open source license agreement and are fully customisable.
You can also, of course, tap in the vast ecosystem of components & code available in the wider React and JavaScript ecosystem.
When the front-end needs the machine to do something, it sends high-level commands to the machine control (&gbc) over a WebSockets interface.
It also receives messages, multiple times a second, containing the state of the machine.

Messages are sent to and from &gbc in JSON format and this protocol is open and documented.
For more information, see [&gbc Schema Reference](/docs/gbc/schema), or the [React hook](/docs/gbr/hooks/useSoloActivity) that abstracts away most of the details.

## LAYER 2 - &gbcl

&gbc takes high-level machine commands from the front-end over a web socket connection and processes them internally,
in order to create an output process image detailing the desired state of all drives and digital outputs. This then transmitted on the fieldbus every cycle (as frequently as every millisecond).

In reverse, the input process image is updated from the fieldbus and sent back to the front-end in the form of high level web socket messages.

When running on a Linux platform, the process image is available via a shared memory interface for use by &gbeml, &gbsml or a custom process
that is responsible for reading and writing from the fieldbus or to motors and IO. On an embedded platform this typically uses a dual port memory (Q)SPI interface.

&gbc calculates the trajectories for any motion commands issued and performs the forward and inverse kinematics for different machine configurations.

&gbc is the only closed source component of the &gbt.

## LAYER 3 - &gbeml & &gbsml

The process image generated by &gbc needs to be written to and read from drives & IO.

We provide a number of options to enable this:

All are available either on Linux or embedded microcontroller.

* Option 1 - When communicating with EtherCAT drives and IO, we provide &gbem, an EtherCAT master based on the SOEM open source EtherCAT master stack.
* Option 2 - If you want to integrate &gbt with a different EtherCAT master, we provide an interface layer to integrate with common EtherCAT slave ICs (for example Microchip's LAN9252/3) to provide an EtherCAT slave interface.
* Option 3 - If you want to integrate &gbt into a non-EtherCAT network (for example, Ethernert/IP, Profinet), we provide an interface layer to the Hilscher netX chipset. We also have integrations with different open source Ethernet fieldbus masters.
* Option 4 - If you want to communicate with stepper/servo/BLDC motors through motor driver ICs, we provide &gbsm to communciate with chips over SPI (our reference design uses the Trinamic chip set)
