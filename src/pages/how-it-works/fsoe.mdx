Function Safety is about ensuring your product operates correctly and safely in response to its inputs, even when there are faults or
failures within the system. For robots working in close conjunction with machines, we are talking about high integrity levels - SIL3, PL-e level.

Functional safety for simple machines relates mainly to implementing estop, stopping in response to different inputs, interlocks, limits on individual motor’s motion, and so on.

For complex machines incorporating robotics, especially those working in close proximity to people, the functional safety requirements take on a new dimension:

- You want to express position limits in terms of where the end-effector of the robots is rather than the position of an individual drive in simpler machines
- Speed limits related to the speed of robot’s end-effector
- Torque limits on the torques individual joints of the robot can produce and the force/toque the end-effector can exert
- All Limits need to switched between values depending on the “mode” of the machine

## How we deliver functional safety

We we work with advanced FSoE drives (Synapticon Circulo, Kollmorgen AKD2G, Baumüller b maXX, Bosch Indradrive and others).

Together with the BBH products FSoE master (SCU-X-EC) we are able to offer advanced functional safety with our software products.

We have developed kinematics support in BBH to validate and limit end-effector velocity, plus other advanced functions.

BBH Safety PLC allows the development and safety certification of products with sophisticated functional safety capabilities with SIL 3 integrity without long and complex development cycles.

This has previously only been accessible to the big robot/machine vendors with large product development budgets. Previously it required
electronic development of the dual CPU environment for the safety controller and custom low-level embedded software development.
All wrapped in the formal methods that safety software development requires.
