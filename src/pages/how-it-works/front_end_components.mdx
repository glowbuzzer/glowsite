## Overview of &gb for React (GBR)

The &gbt ships with a suite of front-end React components including full source code.
You can use many of these components unmodified (such as the component to connect to a machine)
while others can be the starting point for you to modify to your specific needs.

The framework is built on other open source projects, primarily React, Redux & Ant Design.

Below is a description of a handful of the components to give you a flavour of what's available. See <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/gbr/overview">&gbrl; Documentation</GlowsiteLink> for the full suite of components.

In addition to the visual components &gbr provides a Redux store and set of hooks that make it easy to control your machine from the browser. You can extend the Redux store as required.

## HMI options

### Browser based HMIs

Machine control applications built with the &gbt are web applications and any device running a modern browser that uses the V8 engine (Chrome, and Chromium based browsers such as Edge, Opera and so on)
can be used.

This includes many HMI panels available from manufacturers like Phoenix Contact, Beijer Electronics, ABB, Exor and so on.

### React on mobile

Sometimes you need your application to be installed and run natively as an application on the mobile device (such as a phone or tablet running Android or iOS).
As a developer this gives you access to the low-level capabilities of the device, which go beyond those available in a browser environment.

You can use React Native to develop a &gb powered user interface on both Android and iOS. Using React Native, you don’t have to use Android Studio with Java/Kotlin or Xcode with Swift.
Instead, you use your usual web IDE and use JavaScript. You just need the Google or Apple tools to upload the finished application to the app store.

Using React Native you can maintain a code base that is largely shared between Android and iOS.

When it comes to distributing your app you can choose between the following options:

- You can make your app publicly available in the app store
- You can use one of the B2B programmes available from Google or Apple to control access to the application within the store
- You can distribute your application outside of the app store, for example using TestFlight

For further information about using React Native, [see our blog post](/blogs/webdev/react_native).

{/*
In terms of how to distribute the app, obviously for end customers, a public app. store is best.

For example, with Apple you need to register for the iOS Developer license which costs $99 per year and enables you to publish apps to the public store. Apple also have their B2B Apps Program for $299 per year which allows for apps that are not available on the public app. store and your customer use a coupon to install the app.

There are also various other mechanisms to distribute apps for testing purposes outside of the store (for example, TestFlight).

Similar arrangements exist with Google and the Play store.

With React Native, you can have a shared codebase between Android and iOS apps.

The downsides of React Native are slightly less performance, especially for data-heavy apps. But, it’s good enough for most of Facebook though!

### Android on embedded

You can run Android on non-phone devices for example, HMIs. Industrial Android, as the name suggests, is a great option for HMIs.

Android is not only the most popular operating system for mobile devices today, it's also broadly deployed in many industrial scenarios.
It provides a great user interface and a stack of reusable software components, simplifying development and making available millions of
existing applications and libraries.

Industrial Android offers additional features which are not available in stock Android such as:

- Full kiosk mode
- Extended connectivity with device management
- Integrated FOTA support
