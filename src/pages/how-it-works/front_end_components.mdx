## React components (GBR)

The &gbt ships with many front-end React components these are collectively called GBR. You will probably use some of these components unmodified (e.g. the component to connect to a machine) while others can be the starting point for you to modify to your specific needs.

The framework is built on other open source projects, primarily React, Redux & Ant Design.

We have selected a handful of the components here to give you a flavour of what's available. But see: <Link to="/docs/ui/overview">User interface Documentation</Link> to see the full suite of components.

* **Machine connection and state machine** - connecting to the machine or robot and taking it through its start-up state machine viewing any errors that may occur
* **Jogging** - manually moving the machine or robot either in cartesian or joint space
* **DRO** - where is the machine, in joint-space, in cartesian space in different frames
* **Task/activities** - interaction with the control programs (tasks and activities)
* **Analogue and digital in/out** - see that state of inputs and set the state of outputs on the machine
* **g-code** - load and send gcode to the machine
* **Path view** - shows in a 3D view where the machine is and the path the program will take the TCP on
* **Robot/machine view** - for machines with non-trivial kinematics (robots) shows a 3d view of the machine
* **Telemetry** - shows the trajectories that are sent to drives (for diagnostic purposes)


Here you can see the documentation for a few components:

<Tabs defaultActiveKey="1">
    <Tabs.TabPane tab="Cartesian DRO" key="1" >
        <GlowbuzzerApp minWidth={"1px"}>
        ```jsx demo
        import * as React from "react";
        import {CartesianDro} from '@glowbuzzer/controls';
        export default () => <CartesianDro kinematicsConfigurationIndex={0}/>
        ```
        </GlowbuzzerApp>

    </Tabs.TabPane>
    <Tabs.TabPane tab="Frame view" key="2">

        <GlowbuzzerApp minWidth={"1px"}>
        ```jsx demo
            import * as React from "react";
            import {FrameView} from "@glowbuzzer/controls";
            export default () => <FrameView/>
            ```
        </GlowbuzzerApp>

    </Tabs.TabPane>
    <Tabs.TabPane tab="Bit Field Display" key="3">

        ```jsx demo
        import * as React from "react";
        import {BitFieldDisplay} from "@glowbuzzer/controls";
        export default () => <BitFieldDisplay value={111} bitCount={16}/>
        ```

    </Tabs.TabPane>
</Tabs>





You will import the controls you need into your project:

```js
import {
    CartesianDro,
    ConnectTile,
    DigitalInputsTile,
    DigitalOutputsTile,
    FeedRateTile,
    GCodeTile,
    JogTile,
    ToolPathTile
} from "@glowbuzzer/controls"
```

## HMI options

### Browser based HMIs

Machine control applications built with the &gbt are web applications and any device running a modern browser that uses the V8 engine (Chrome, and Chromium based browsers for example, Microsoft Edge, Opera etc.) can happily display the applications.

This includes many HMI panels available from manufacturers like Phoenix Contact, Beijer Electronics, ABB, Exor etc.

### React on mobile

However, sometimes you need your application to run as a proper application on the mobile device (phone/tablet running Android or IoS). Most of the time you interact with an app on your phone or tablet (banking, facebook etc.) it is with an app actually running on the device, not through the browser, as it gives the developers the mechanisms to build a much better user experience.

You can use React Native to develop both Android and iOS apps.

This means, you don’t have to use Android Studio with Java/Kotlin or Xcode with Swift. Instead, you can use your usual IDE and use JavaScript/TypeScript. (You just need the Google/apple IDEs to upload the finished application to the stores).

In terms of how to distribute the app, obviously for end customers, a public app. store is best.

For example, with Apple you need to register for the iOS Developer license which costs $99 per year and enables you to publish apps to the public store. Apple also have their B2B Apps Program for $299 per year which allows for apps that are not available on the public app. store and your customer use a coupon to install the app.

There are also various other mechanisms to distribute apps for testing purposes outside of the store (e.g. TestFlight).

Similar arrangements exist with Google and the Play store.

With React native, you can have a shared codebase between Android and iOS apps.

The downsides of React Native are slightly less performance, especially for data-heavy apps. But, it’s good enough for most of Facebook though!

### Android on embedded

You can run Android on non-phone devices for example, HMIs.

Industrial Android, as the name suggests, is a great option for HMIs.

Android is not only the most popular OS for mobile devices today, but also broadly deployed in different industrial use cases. It provides a great user interface and a stack of reusable software components, simplifying development and maintaining millions of existing applications and libraries.

Industrial Android offers additional features which are not available on the stock Android like: full kiosk mode, extended connectivity with device management and integrated FOTA support.
