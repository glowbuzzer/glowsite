A motion control calculates the trajectories that the motors follow in order to meet the desired commanded movement.

At the heart of the &gbt is our own innovative trajectory planner that computes time optimal and time synchronised multi-dimensional third-order trajectories
complying with motion limits on velocity, acceleration and jerk. This provides the core of our 3D-axis, synchronised axis and single-axis motion control capabilities.

A trajectory is often given as a sequence of positions over time, and these implicitly determine acceleration and jerk. Trajectories are sent to the drives which control the motors.
The trajectories are calculated cyclically, for example every millisecond. Each drive must receive the trajectory at precisely the same moment if you want to execute synchronised
movements using multiple motors. Hence, the need for real-time execution and a time synchronised fieldbus.

The following screen show the calculation that occurs inside the &gb trajectory planner each cycle according to the commanded motion at that instant. The trajectory planner
is able to plan from any initial velocity and acceleration, and so a move can be cancelled and a new one planned instantly and at any state of motion.

*Example inputs*

- Velocity limit (`vmax`) 1040mm/s
- Acceleration limit (`amax`) 3300mm/s&sup2;
- Jerk limit (`jmax`) 314800mm/s&sup3;
- Current velocity (`vstart`) 0mm/s;
- Current acceleration (`astart`) 100mm/s&sup2;
- Target position (`pwayp`) 1000mm;
- Target velocity (`vwayp`) 0mm/s;

Given these inputs, the trajectory planner produces a motion profile consisting of three phases: acceleration, cruise and deceleration to the target position,
and determines the minimum time required to complete the move as 1.287 seconds.
