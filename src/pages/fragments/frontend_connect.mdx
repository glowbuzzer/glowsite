In the browser, the "Connection Tile" is the goto place for all things relating to connecting to &gbc and controlling the machine state.

The following diagram illustrates the key features of the Connection Tile.

To connect, first click the "Connect" button in the top bar. This establishes the web-sockets connection between &gbr and &gbc.

Next, by default you are in simulation mode. This means commands sent to &gbc are not passed onto any machine connected to &gbc.

If you want to control a machine for real, you need to click the "Live" button.

Whether you are in Simulation mode or Live, "Current state" will tell you the current (CiA-402) state of the machine.

If the machine is in Fault state, you will need to click the "Fault reset" button to clear the fault.

Next, the "Machine operation" buttons take the machine through its state machine. Either up to "Operation Enabled" or down to "Operation Disabled".

If you are developing locally, "preferences" section of drop-down make sure the websockets connection is targeted `ws://localhost:9001/ws`.

See below.

If you are targeting a remote &gbc instance (for example on a Raspberry Pi) then target this host with `ws://my-rpi:9001/ws`.
