To connect the &gbr to &gbc, the folowing steps are needed:

1. In the browser, click "connect" to establish a connection to &gbc.

import connect_tile from "../fragments/connect_tile.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={connect_tile} alt="front-end connect tile" maxWidth={400}/>

If you are developing locally, "preferences" section of drop-down make sure the websockets connection is targetted `ws://localhost:9001/ws`.

If you are targetting a remote &gbc instance (for example on a Raspberry Pi) then target this host with `ws://my-rpi:9001/ws`.
