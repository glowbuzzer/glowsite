       message={"These instructions assume you are going to run GBC on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), a virtual Linux machine or an Intel Linux system on your network."}/>

In the Linux shell, move to the directory in which you want to install &gbc. Enter the following command to download the latest release:

```shell
wget https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/linux-amd64/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```

You can also use `curl` or similar command to download the compressed tar archive.

Extract files from the archive using:
```shell
tar -xzf gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```
This will create directory `./&gbc_version;` containing the `GBC` executable and sample configuration files.
