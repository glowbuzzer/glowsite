The installation of &gbc requires that you download binaries.

Assuming you want to test this out on WSL or a virtual or real Linux platform, the location of the download is as follows:

`https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/linux-amd64/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz`

First, move to the directory in which you want to install &gbc. Then download &gbc using `wget`.

If `wget` needs installing, install with:
```shell
sudo apt install wget //for different linux variants this will need to use the command for their package manager
```

Otherwise, just run:
```shell
wget downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/linux-amd64/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```

Then uncompress with:
```shell
tar -xzf gbc.tgz
```
