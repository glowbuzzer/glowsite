The installation of &gbc requires that you download binaries.

Assuming you want to test this out on WSL or a virtual or real Linux platform, the location of the download is as follows:

```shell
https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/linux-amd64/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```

First, move to the directory in which you want to install &gbc. Then download &gbc using `wget` or `curl` like this:

```shell
wget https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/linux-amd64/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```

Then uncompress with:
```shell
tar -xzf gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```
