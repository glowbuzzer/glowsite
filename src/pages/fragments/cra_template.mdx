We provide a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) (CRA) custom template as a useful starting point for your project. This helps reduce setup and
configuration work needed to get started.

You should perform these steps on your development workstation (Windows or Linux or WSL).

## Prerequisites

You need Node.js installed. We recommend version 12 or above. When installing Node.js, `npm` and `npx` are typically installed automatically, but if you need to install these
manually, use:

```shell
sudo apt install npm
```

Or use the package manager for your chosen Linux distribution.

## Creating a new project

Execute the following commands to create a new project:

```shell
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template glowbuzzer-typescript --use-npm
cd your-project-name
npm start
```

On first run this will download all the required packages which can take a while. What you should see on your screen is something like this:

import cra_template from "./cra_start.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={cra_template} alt="CRA start"/>

When you run the `start` command, a local development server is started which will serve the React application. This can be accessed on localhost, on port 3000 by default, for
example: http://localhost:3000. CRA may be able to launch your browser automatically dependending on your environment.

You can open this project in your IDE (JetBrains, VS code and so on). Changes will trigger a hot reload in the browser.
