We provide a CRA custom template as a useful starting point for your toolkit project which helps to cut out setup and configuration work needed to get started.

You will perform this step on your PC (Windows or Linux or WSL).

To get going, you need to:

```shell
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template glowbuzzer-typescript
cd your-project-name
yarn start
```

This should then busy away downloading all the required packages. What you should see on your screen is something like this:

import cra_template from "./cra_start.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={cra_template} alt="CRA start"/>


It is possible that before you run the `npx` command that you need to:
* install npm with - `sudo apt install npm` or `sudo dnf install npm` or `sudo pacman -S npm` depending on your Linux flavour
* npx is installed with npm, but you can  install npx with - `npm install --global npx`
* install yarn with - `npm install --global yarn`



When you run the `start` command, this will run your starter project's React application under a local dev. server which can be accessed from the browser under `localhost:xxxx`.
(Depending on your environment, the browser may launch automatically.)

You can also now open this project in your IDE (JetBrains, VS code etc.).
