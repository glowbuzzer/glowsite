We provide an npm package that will bootstrap a new glowbuzzer React project. This helps reduce setup and
configuration work needed to get started.

You should perform these steps on your development workstation (Windows or Linux or WSL).

## Prerequisites

You need Node.js installed. We recommend version 16 or above. When installing Node.js, `npm` and `npx` are typically installed automatically, but if you need to install these
manually, use:

```shell
sudo apt install npm
```

Or use the package manager for your chosen Linux distribution.

## Creating a new project

Execute the following commands to create a new project:

```shell
npx create-glowbuzzer-app
```

This will prompt for a project name and then create a new directory with that name. It will then download and configure the latest version of the glowbuzzer React template.

Once this command completes, change to the new directory and run the following command:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

You can also use `pnpm` or `yarn` instead of `npm` if you prefer.

On first run this will download all the required packages which might take a while. What you should see on your screen is something like this:

import cra_template from "./cra_start.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={cra_template} alt="CRA start"/>

When you run the `start` command, a local development server is started which will serve the React application. This can be accessed on localhost, on port 5173 by default, for
example: http://localhost:5173.

You can open this project in your IDE (JetBrains, VS Code and so on). Changes will trigger a hot reload in the browser.
