To run &gbem, usually `./GBEM -c -ieth0` is enough.

`eth0` refers to the name of Ethernet interface which will be used for EtherCAT traffic and if your Linux platform's interface is named differently, then this will need adjusting.

The `-c` refers to cyclic mode where &gbem runs cyclically at the specified fieldbus bus cycle period.

Before, &gbem can be run.

More information on the command line options and configuration options can be found in <Link to="/docs/gbem/overview"> &gbem Documentation</Link>
