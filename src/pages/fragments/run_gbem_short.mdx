To run GBEM, usually `./GBEM -c -ieth0` is enough.

`eth0` refers to the name of Ethernet interface which will be used for EtherCAT traffic and if your Linux platform's interface is named differently, then this will need adjusting.

The `-c` refers to cyclic mode where GBEM runs cyclically at the specified fieldbus bus cycle period.

Before, GBEM can be run.
