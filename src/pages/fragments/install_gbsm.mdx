&gbsm needs to be downloaded from GitHub and compiled locally.

First, download from GitHub by cloning the repositiory. The `--recursive` option needs to be added to the `clone` command as the repository uses sub-modules and you need to also download these to be able to compile it.

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbsm
```
This will clone the project and the sub-modules it depends on into `gbsm` directory.

Next we need to compile the code. This can either be done by importing the code into your IDE and doing the build there or from the command line.

First `cd` into the `gbsm` directory. Then

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DFLAVOUR=PI
make
```
If you don't specify `-DFLAVOUR=PI` then a generic Linux build will be processed.

This will create the GBSM binary in the `builds` directory that can be run with `./GBSM` and the appropriate command line options..

You can also do a `sudo make install` if you want to copy the executable into the `bin` directory.
