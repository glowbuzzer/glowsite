The installation of &gbc required that you download binaries.

We provide the binaries for 64-bit Linux and the Raspberry Pi for evaluation. Other platforms can be supplied on request.

The location of the download is as follows:

* Raspberry PI (arm7 32 bit)
`https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/gbc-armv7.tar.gz`

* Linux (64 bit)
`https://download.glowbuzzer.com/gbc/gbc-amd64.tar.gz`

First, move to the directory in which you want to install &gbc. Then download &gbc using `wget`.

If `wget` needs installing, install with:
```shell
sudo apt install wget //for different linux variants this will need to use the command for thier package manager
```

Otherwise, just run:
```shell
wget https://download.glowbuzzer.com/gbc-armv7.tar.gz
```

Then uncompresss with:
```shell
tar -xzf gbc-armv7.tar.gz
```

&gbc has a set of JSON configuration files that configure its main parameters. These need to be located in the same directory as the GBC executable file.

The tar file you download will contain some example configuration files.

For example for the start kits, copy the following files into the &gbc directory:

'machine_starter_kit_1.json`
`default.json`
`fieldbus.json`
`example_tasks.json`


See <Link to="/docs/gbc/configuration"> Configuration of GBC</Link> for more details.
