The installation of &gbc requires that you download binaries.

We provide the binaries for 64-bit Linux and the Raspberry Pi for evaluation. Other platforms can be supplied on request.

The location of the download is as follows:

* Raspberry PI (arm7 32 bit)
````shell
https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/linux-amd64/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
````

* Linux (64 bit)
````shell
https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/rpi/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
````


First, move to the directory in which you want to install &gbc. Then download &gbc using `wget` or `curl` like this:

```shell
wget https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/linux-amd64/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```


Then uncompress with:
```shell
tar -xzf gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
```

&gbc has a set of JSON configuration files that configure its main parameters.

The tar file you download will contain some example configuration files.

For example for the starter kits you will have:

`machine_starter_kit_1.json`

GBC needs to be executed with a parameter to pas in this configuration file:

```shell
./GBC -cmachine_starter_kit_1.json
```

See <Link to="/docs/gbc/configuration"> Configuration of GBC</Link> for more details on all the command lines options for GBC.
