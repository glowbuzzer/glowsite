The installation of &gbc requires that you download binaries.

We provide the binaries for 64-bit Linux and the Raspberry Pi for evaluation. Other platforms can be supplied on request.

The location of the download is as follows:

* Raspberry PI (arm7 32 bit)
`https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/rpi/refs/tags/v1.0.0rc6/gbc.tgz`

* Linux (64 bit)
`https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/linux-amd64/refs/tags/v1.0.0rc6/gbc.tgz`

First, move to the directory in which you want to install &gbc. Then download &gbc using `wget`.

If `wget` needs installing, install with:
```shell
sudo apt install wget //for different linux variants this will need to use the command for thier package manager
```

Otherwise (change the URL if you want the Raspberry Pi version), just run:
```shell
wget https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/linux-amd64/refs/tags/v1.0.0rc6/gbc.tgz
```

Then uncompress with:
```shell
tar -xzf gbc.tgz
```



(The package manager command will need changing for different Linux versions)

&gbc has a set of JSON configuration files that configure its main parameters.

The tar file you download will contain some example configuration files.
