We need a Raspberry Pi with a preempt patched kernel on which to run the core control. The front-end React application will talk to this over web-sockets.

The easiest way to install this is to use our image.

Download from `https://download.glowbuzzer.com/pi-rt-image.img.z`

(We do provide instructions on how to build the kernel yourself if your feel inclined - see <Link to="/docs/gbem/compiling_and_running"> here.</Link>)

Next, uncompress the downloaded image either with a Linux `uncompress` command or using the Windows tools.

Next, the 32gb SD card must have the image written to it. On Windows use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">Win32 Disk imager</a> or <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/"> Etcher</a>.

On Linux, google "Writing an SD Card Image Using Linux Command Line Tools" and follow the instructions from a good source.

Once the image is written, you can plug in to your Raspberry Pi and the power it up.

If all is well, log onto the pi with ssh:


```shell
ssh root@rpi-gb
```

password - `raspberry`
