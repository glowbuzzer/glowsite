&gbem needs to be downloaded from GitHub and compiled locally.

First, download from GitHub by cloning the repository. The `--recursive` option needs to be added to the `clone` command as the repository uses sub-modules and you need to also download these to be able to compile it.

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbem
```

This will clone the project and the sub-modules it depends on into `gbsm` directory.

Next we need to compile the code. This can either be done by importing the code into your IDE and doing the build there or from the command line.

First `cd` into the `gbem` directory. Then

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DFLAVOUR=PI
make
```
If you don't specify `-DFLAVOUR=PI` then a generic Linux build will be processed.

This will create the GBEM binary in the `builds` directory that can be run with `./GBEM` and the appropriate command line options.

You can also do a `sudo make install` if you want to copy the executable into the `bin` directory.

You will need to install `libbsd` as we use some of its networking functions. This can be done with the Linux package manager:

```shell
sudo apt install libbsd-dev
```
