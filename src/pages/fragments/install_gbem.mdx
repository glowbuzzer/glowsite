&gbem needs to be downloaded from GitHub and compiled locally.

Download from GitHub by cloning the repository:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbem
```

The `--recursive` option is important as the repository uses sub-modules which also need to be fetched.

You will need to install `libbsd-dev` as we use some of its networking functions. This can be done with the Linux package manager:

```shell
sudo apt install libbsd-dev
```

{props.children}

Configure build files and compile:

```shell
cd gbem
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DFLAVOUR=PI
make
```

If you don't specify `-DFLAVOUR=PI` then a generic Linux build will be built.

This will create the GBEM binary in the `builds` directory that can be run with `./GBEM` and the appropriate command line options.

You can also run `sudo make install` if you want to copy the executable into the `bin` directory.
