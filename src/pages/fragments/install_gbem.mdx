GBEM needs to be downloaded from GitHub and compiled locally.

First, download from GitHub into an appropriate directory, with:
`git clone https://gitgub.com/glowbuzzer/gbem`

And then `cd` into the directory.

Then, either import the code into your IDE and build there or from the command line:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will then provide you with an executable to run.
