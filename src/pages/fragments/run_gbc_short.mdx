To run GBC, you may need to specify the configuration file.

If you want to run the generic demo just run `./GBC` as it will use the "built-in" configuration.

If you want to the Staubli robot demo, then use:

`./GBC -cmachine_tx40.json`

On running GBC, the first console output should look something like this.

```text
[INFO  ] GBC: **************************************************************************
[INFO  ] GBC: ***                         Starting GB Control                        ***
[INFO  ] GBC: **************************************************************************
[WARN  ] GBC: No valid port was specified on the command line. Will use the default [9001]
[WARN  ] GBC: No valid signal was specified on the command line. Will use the default [29]

```
