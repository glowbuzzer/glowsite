&gbc uses a JSON configuration file that configures its main parameters.

The tar file you download will contain some example configuration files.

For example for the starter kits you will have:

`machine_starter_kit_1.json`

GBC needs to be executed with a parameter to pas in this configuration file:

```shell
./GBC -cmachine_starter_kit_1.json
```

See <Link to="/docs/gbc/configuration"> Configuration of GBC</Link> for more details on all the command lines options for GBC.
