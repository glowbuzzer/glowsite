# Simulation mode
<Tldr>
    - You can test the toolkit with no hardware
    - Runs "self-contained" on WSL (or Linux itself)
    - Test out the pre-built react components
    - Develop your own React components
</Tldr>
Simulation is a way to test the glowbuzzer toolkit without needing any hardware.

It is also used to speed up the development of front-end components by allowing you to develop front-end machine control applications without having to fire-up specific hardware (drives, IO, fieldbusses etc.).

Testing the glowbuzzer toolkit in simulation mode means you can exercise a large part of the software from a Windows PC running WSL or a normal Linux PC. No Linux real-time extensions are required.

There are two steps to get started in simulation mode:

1. Download & run the front-end components
1. Download & run GBC (the core control)
