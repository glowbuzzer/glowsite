<Tldr>
    - You can test the toolkit with no hardware
    - Runs on WSL, VM (or Linux itself)
    - Test out our pre-built react components
    - Develop your own React components
    - Run front-end for our wed
</Tldr>

## What is simulation mode?
Simulation is a way to test the &gbt without needing any hardware (motors, IO etc.).

It is also used to speed up the development of front-end components by allowing you to build React machine control applications without having to fire-up specific hardware (drives, IO, fieldbusses etc.).

Testing the &gbt in simulation mode means you can exercise a large part of the software from a Windows PC running WSL/VM or a normal Linux PC. No Linux real-time extensions are required.

## Step 1 - Installing and running &gbc
First you need to install &gbc (the real-time core control) on WSL/VM or Linux itself.

Then you will connect &gbr to &gbc over the network.

<RunGbc/>

## Step 2 - Running &gbr

The easiest way to start is to use our hosted versions of &gbr from our website.

There are two example applications available for you to play with:

1. generic - an example control for a cartesian machine - <a href="https://www.glowbuzzer.com/xxxx">available here</a>
1. staubli - an example control for a 6-DOF industrial robot - <a href="https://www.glowbuzzer.com/yyyy">available here</a>


## Step 3 - Test the basic functions of &gbr

### Connect to &gbc

<FrontendConnect/>

### Jog a motor

<Jog/>

## Step 4 - going further

The next step is to have local copy of &gbr for you to customise further.
