<Tldr>
    - You can test the toolkit with no hardware
    - Runs on WSL, VM (or Linux itself)
    - Test out our pre-built react components
    - Develop your own React components
    - Run front-end for our wed
</Tldr>

## What is simulation mode?
Simulation is a way to test the &gbt without needing any hardware (motors, IO etc.).

It is also used to speed up the development of front-end components by allowing you to build React machine control applications without having to fire-up specific hardware (drives, IO, fieldbusses etc.).

Testing the &gbt in simulation mode means you can exercise a large part of the software from a Windows PC running WSL/VM or a normal Linux PC. No Linux real-time extensions are required.


## How to quickly get started with simulation mode

We offer two demo applications for you to see what &gbr offers.



<BogStandardRow>
    <BogStandardCol lg={12} xs={24}>
        <h3><CartesianIcon/>  Generic</h3>
        * Control for a cartesian machine
        * 3 joints plus one auxiliary axis
        * Cartesian kinematics model
        * Range of IO (analog, digital etc.)
        <Image src={generic_gbr}/>
    </BogStandardCol>
    <BogStandardCol lg={12} xs={24}>
        <h3><RobotIcon/>  Staubli</h3>
        * Control for a 6-DOF robot

        * No IO
        <Image src={staubli_gbr}/>
    </BogStandardCol>
</BogStandardRow>

So, follow the simple instructions below for either the Generic or Staubli demos.

<Tabs defaultActiveKey="1"  >
    <TabPane tab={<span><h2><CartesianIcon/>  Generic</h2></span>} key="1">
        ### Step 1 - Running &gbr
        The easiest way to start is to use our hosted version of &gbr from our website.

        The generic demo (a cartesian machine with 3-axes and an auxiliary axis) is <a href="https://preview.glowbuzzer.com/examples/generic/index.html">available here</a>

        You will not be able to use the front-end until you have installed &gbc, the real-time control on your PC.

        ### Step 2 - Installing and running &gbc
        First you need to install &gbc (the real-time core control) on WSL/Linux Virtual Machine or a full Linux installation.

        Then you will connect &gbr to &gbc together over the network and will be able to test out key functions of the software.

        <InstallGbc/>

        To run GBC for the generic demo, we can use its "built-in" configuration so we just need to run:

        ```shell
            ./GBC
        ```

        On running GBC, the first console output should look something like this.

        ```text
        [INFO  ] GBC: **************************************************************************
        [INFO  ] GBC: ***                         Starting GB Control                        ***
        [INFO  ] GBC: **************************************************************************
        [WARN  ] GBC: No valid port was specified on the command line. Will use the default [9001]
        [WARN  ] GBC: No valid signal was specified on the command line. Will use the default [29]

        ```

        Now &gbc is running, the next step is to connect &gbr to &gbc and test out key functionality.


        ### Step 3 - Test the basic functions of &gbr

        #### **Connect to &gbc**

        <FrontendConnect/>

        #### **Jog a motor**

        <Jog/>


    </TabPane>
    <TabPane tab={<span><h2><RobotIcon/>  Staubli</h2></span>} key="2">
        ### Step 1 - Running &gbr
        The easiest way to start is to use our hosted versions of &gbr from our website.

        The Staubli demo (a 6-DOF industrial robot) <a href="https://preview.glowbuzzer.com/examples/staubli/index.html">available here</a>

        You will not be able to use the front-end until you have installed &gbc, the real-time control on your PC.

        ### Step 2 - Installing and running &gbc
        First you need to install &gbc (the real-time core control) on WSL/Linux Virtual Machine or a full Linux installation.

        Then you will connect &gbr to &gbc together over the network and will be able to test out key functions of the software.

        <InstallGbc/>

        To run GBC for the Staubli demo, we need to specifiy a configuration file so we run:

        ```shell
        ./GBC -cmachine_tx40.json
        ```

        On running GBC, the first console output should look something like this.

        ```text
        [INFO  ] GBC: **************************************************************************
        [INFO  ] GBC: ***                         Starting GB Control                        ***
        [INFO  ] GBC: **************************************************************************
        [WARN  ] GBC: No valid port was specified on the command line. Will use the default [9001]
        [WARN  ] GBC: No valid signal was specified on the command line. Will use the default [29]

        ```

Now &gbc is running, the next step is to connect &gbr to &gbc and test out key functionality.

        ### Step 3 - Test the basic functions of &gbr

        #### Connect to &gbc

        <FrontendConnect/>

        #### Jog a motor

        <Jog/>
