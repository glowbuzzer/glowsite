<Tldr>
    - You can test the toolkit with no hardware
    - Runs "self-contained" on WSL (or Linux itself)
    - Test out the pre-built react components
    - Develop your own React components

## What is simulation mode?
Simulation is a way to test the &gbt without needing any hardware.

It is also used to speed up the development of front-end components by allowing you to develop front-end machine control applications without having to fire-up specific hardware (drives, IO, fieldbusses etc.).

Testing the &gbt in simulation mode means you can exercise a large part of the software from a Windows PC running WSL or a normal Linux PC. No Linux real-time extensions are required.

## Step 1 - Installing &gbr

<CraTemplate/>

This application needs to connect to &gbc. Installing and running this is the next step.

## Step 2 - Installing and running &gbc

<InstallGbc/>

<RunGbc/>


## Step 3 - Test

### Connect to &gbc

<FrontendConnect/>

### Jog a motor

<Jog/>
