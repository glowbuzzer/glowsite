# Simulation mode
<Tldr>
    - You can test the toolkit with no hardware
    - Runs "self-contained" on WSL (or Linux itself)
    - Test out the pre-built react components
    - Develop your own React components
</Tldr>
Simulation is a way to test the glowbuzzer toolkit without needing any hardware.

It is also used to speed up the development of front-end components by allowing you to develop front-end machine control applications without having to fire-up specific hardware (drives, IO, fieldbusses etc.).

Testing the glowbuzzer toolkit in simulation mode means you can exercise a large part of the software from a Windows PC running WSL or a normal Linux PC. No Linux real-time extensions are required.

# Step 1 - Installing the front-end components

We provide a CRA custom template as a useful starting point for your toolkit project which helps to cut out setup and configuration work needed to get started.

This can be run either on Windows or Linux.

To get going, you need to:

````shell
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template [gb-starter]
cd your-project-name
npm start
````

This will run the gb-starter React application under a local dev server which can be accessed from the browser under `localhost:xxxx`

You can also now open this project in your IDE.

This application needs to connect to GBC (the real-time control component of the toolkit). Installing and running this is the next step.

# Step 2 - Installing and running GBC

GBC needs to run under Linux. WSL 1 or 2 is adequate.

GBC is supplied as a pre-compiled binary which can be downloaded from `https://download.glowbuzzer.com/gbc/gbc-amd64.tar.xz`.

so use a `wget https://download.glowbuzzer.com/gbc/gbc-amd64.tar.xz`

and a `tar xf gbc-amd64.tar.xz` to unpack


`./GBC`

explain GBC command line options

explain what they see

## Step 3 - Test

Inside the browser, you should now be able to use the connect button to connect to GBC

You will need to stay in sim mode.



jog
io toggle
etc.
