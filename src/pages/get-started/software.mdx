## Introduction

This page explains how to install the &gb components &gbc and &gbem in order to get some drives moving and control some IO.
We assume you have already covered:

[Running &gbc in simulation mode](/get-started/simulation)

: Describes how to quickly get started using a generic front-end connecting to &gbc (no hardware required)

[Assembling the single or three axis starter kit](/get-started/kits/overview)

: Describes the parts needed and gives detailed assembly instructions

    {/*
## Step 1 - Use the create react app custom template to create your getting started project

The easiest way to start is to use our hosted version of &gbr from our website.

The generic demo (a cartesian machine with 3-axes and an auxiliary axis) is <a href="https://preview.glowbuzzer.com/examples/generic/index.html">available here</a> and is suitable for using with the starter kit hardware.

You will not be able to use the front-end until you have installed &gbc, the real-time control on your PC.

For use with real hardware this needs to run on Linux with real-time extensions. The easiest way to get started with this is to use the &pi but of course you can use a desktop version of Linux.

    ## Install &pi OS

    To run &gbc and &gbem you need a &pi with a preempt patched kernel, in order to eliminate jitter.

    The easiest way to install this is to use our image, which you can download from
    `https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/pi-rt-image.img.z`.
    We do provide [instructions on how to build the kernel yourself](/docs/gbem/compiling_and_running) if you feel
    inclined.

    The image needs to be written to a 32Gb SD card. Uncompress the downloaded image either with a Linux `uncompress`
    command or using the Windows tools.
    On Windows write the image to the SD card using [Win32 Disk
    imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher). On Linux, do a
    web search for
    "Writing an SD Card Image Using Linux Command Line Tools" and follow the instructions from a good source.

    Once the SD is ready, you can insert the card in the SD card slot on your &pi and power it up.

    If all is well, log onto the &pi with ssh:

    ```shell
    ssh root@rpi-gb
    ```

    The default hostname of image is `gb-rpi` and the password is `raspberry`

    ## Download and run &gbc

    We provide the &gbc binaries for the &pi for evaluation. Other platforms can be supplied on request.

    Log in to the &pi and download &gbc:

    ````shell
    wget https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/rpi/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
    tar -xzf gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
    cd &gbc_version.tgz
    ````

    Run &gbc

    <PageVariantTabs>
        <Tabs.TabPane tab="Single Axis Kit" key="sk1">
            ```shell
            ./GBC --config machine_starter_kit_1.json
            ```
        </Tabs.TabPane>
        <Tabs.TabPane tab="Three Axis Kit" key="sk2">
            ```shell
            ./GBC --config machine_starter_kit_2.json
            ```
        </Tabs.TabPane>
    </PageVariantTabs>

    &gbc will start and listen for connections on port 9000.

    ## Download, compile and run &gbem

    <InstallGBEM>
        <PageVariantTabs>
            <Tabs.TabPane tab="Single Axis Kit" key="sk1">
                Edit `gbem/libs/machine_mapping/inc/map_config.h` to activate the starter kit configuration. Set `MACHINE_SK1`
                to `1` and set all others to `0`.

                ````shell
                #define MACHINE_SK1 1
                ````
            </Tabs.TabPane>
            <Tabs.TabPane tab="Three Axis Kit" key="sk2">
                Edit `gbem/libs/machine_mapping/inc/map_config.h` to activate the starter kit configuration. Set `MACHINE_SK2`
                to `1` and set all others to `0`.

                ````shell
                #define MACHINE_SK2 1
                ````
            </Tabs.TabPane>
        </PageVariantTabs>
    </InstallGBEM>

    Check that &gbem can connect to the slaves on your EtherCAT network:

    ````shell
    ./gbem -n -ieth0
    ````

    This prints a lot of detailed diagnostic information, and within this you should see the details of the slaves on
    the network.

    You are now ready to run &gbem:
    ```
    ./GBEM -c -ieth0
    ```

    ## Launch and connect the front-end

    The simplest way to launch a front-end is to use the generic demo hosted on the &gb website, as you did in the
    [Quick Start](/get-started/simulation) section.

    <ArrowRightOutlined/> [Launch the generic demo front-end](http://preview.glowbuzzer.com/examples/generic/index.html)

    In the demo application:
    - Modify the connection url using the Preferences button at the top of the page
    - Connect
    - Clear the initial fault
    - Enable operation

    You are now ready to start jogging.
