When it comes to services, everyone needs something different so, our services offering is tailored to what you need.

What support you will need from us will depend on what you need to achieve, what expertise and infrastructure you already have and what resources will be available to your project and in your timeframe.

## Evaluation

We can help you evaluate our technology prior to making a commitment. This may be a paper exercise or involve creating Proof of Concepts or prototyping.

(A proof of concept aims to show if a product, feature or system can be developed within constraints, whilst a prototype shows how it will be developed).

## Pitch and proposal

You may need to make a robust and passionate pitch to a senior team or another part of your organisation or a client or partner for your proposed new machine control software.

We can support you make these proposals and even join you in making presentations.

## Implementation

We can help you build out your product by providing expertise on the machine control, either as a sub-contacted piece of work or working inside your product development team or on a fully-outsourced basis.

## Technology adoption

We can help you make a technology transition plan for your organisation if you are relatively new to web technologies. This might cover:

Creating an adoption pathway highlighting what you are going to need to do to successfully introduce web tech into your organisation.

As with all software technologies, a web stack also requires a development environment and software tooling. You may need help scoping and identifying this environment and understanding how this will fit with any other software environments you have.

We can help you identify the skills your organisation will need, create up-skilling training plans for your existing staff and provide assistance with technical part of new staff recruitment.
