## Introduction
You don't need any hardware to test the &gbt in *simulation mode*. Everything can be run under WSL on a Windows PC or on Linux and no drives or IO is needed.

This will allow you to test out the front-end React components and see how the control behaves and test out writing your own React components to control machines.

See <GlowsiteLink to="/get-started/simulation">simulation mode</GlowsiteLink> for more details on how to run the toolkit without any drives and IO.

But really, the &gbt is all about making things move and for that you need some hardware. That means you need something to run the core control (in real-time) on and some motors and IO to test your control program with.

In terms of the platform to run the toolkit on, the easiest route to getting started is using a Linux single board computer on which the core control and EtherCAT master run. This board is then connected to EtherCAT drive(s) and IO. We suggest using the Raspberry Pi 4.

You will then develop the control application using react on your PC (Windows, Mac, Linux) and the front-end will be accessed through a browser.

Finally, you will need an EtherCAT servo or stepper drive and some EtherCAT IO - you need something to move and some IO to test.

You can provide your own hardware to get started, or we have packages available to order of all the items, cables, power supplier etc. you need.

All the components are common off the shelf, so you can easily order them directly from the manufacturers.

If you use identical hardware to our suggestion, following the tutorials is straight forward, if you use your own hardware then there will be additional configuration steps.

## Starter packages

If your desk is currently piled high with different drives and IO slices, then you are probably going to want to source your own hardware.

If however, you are more of a software person, and drives and IO are a bit alien to you, then the starter kits are a great place to begin and we can provide all the help you need to get things wired up and working.

We offer 3 starter packages:

1. **single axis starter kit - GS_SK_01** - a single Oriental Motor AZD drive (with an absolute encoder motor) with the Raspberry Pi 4 platform - €900
1. **three axis starter kit - GS_SK_02** - three axis Oriental Motor AZD drive with three motors plus 8 channels of Beckhoff digital in/out (EK1100, EL1008, EL2008) plus Raspberry Pi 4 platform- €2300
1. **embedded Linux starter kit - GS_SK_03** - Toradex imx8plus on a Toradex Verdin carrier board plus single Oriental Motor AZD drive (with an absolute encoder motor) - €1300

We build starter packages to order, so adjustments to the bill-of-materials for example, motor shaft options, IO etc. are possible.

For example, with the single axis & embedded Linux starter kits it is highly desirable to have some Beckhoff digital IO available, so we usually add this to this package for customers. This adds around €250 to the price.
