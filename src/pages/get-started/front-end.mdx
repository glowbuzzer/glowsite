## Introduction
This page takes you though installing the &gbt React components (&gbr) and creating a simple machine control &fe of your own.

We assume you have already covered [running &gbc in simulation mode](/get-started/simulation). The instructions below assume you will run &gbc in simulation mode (without hardware),
but you can just as easily run your custom &fe against one of the hardware starter kits.

## Use the CRA template to create your project

We provide a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) (CRA) custom template as a useful starting point for your project. This helps reduce setup and
configuration work needed to get started. You should perform these steps on your development workstation (Windows or Linux or WSL).

You need Node.js and the Node package manager (npm). We recommend version 12 or above.
If you don't have Node.js installed, [visit the Node.js website for instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Execute the following command to create the project from the &gb template:

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template glowbuzzer-typescript --use-npm
```

Replace `my-app` with your project name. This will download all required packages and bootstrap your project. It can take a few minutes.

```text
Creating a new React app in my-app.

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts with cra-template-glowbuzzer-typescript...

[... package install output ...]

Success! Created my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
```

When you run the `start` command, a local development server is started which will serve the React application. This can be accessed on localhost, on port 3000 by default, for
example: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can now open this project in your preferred IDE and start editing (with hot reload enabled).

## Simple tutorials

<PageVariantProvider variants={["tut1", "tut2"]}>

&gbrl provides a simple component named `Tile` you can use to provide a consistent look to your front-ends. You don't have to use this component but much of the &gb basic
functionality like managing the &gbc connection is provided as tiles. Note that full source code for all our components is
[available on Github](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/tree/main/libs/controls) so you can pick apart
our components and re-package them however you need.

We are going to walk through two different tutorials:

Setting a digital output

: Adds a new tile that contains a toggle button that when clicked will toggle a digital output

Oscillating a joint

: Adds a new tile that runs an oscillating move on a single joint and provides visual feedback

<PageVariantTabs>
    <Tabs.TabPane tab="Digital Output Tutorial" key="tut1">
        Let's create the simplest possible machine control function. A button to toggle a digital output. This is the "hello world" equivalent in automation land.

        First verify that you can run the React project you just created and can connect to &gbc.
        You should be able to start &gbc using the generic configuration, that is by running:
        ```shell
        ./GBC --config ../configs/config_generic.json
        ```

        If you are unable to run &gbc, please follow the [Getting Started](./simulation) instructions.

        Adding a tile is just a matter of creating a new React component and using `Tile` as part of it's render function.

        Create a new file `ToggleDigitalOutputTile.tsx` and add the following code:

        ```tsx
        // ToggleDigitalOutputTile.tsx
        import * as React from "react"
        import {Space, Switch} from "antd"
        import {Tile} from "@glowbuzzer/controls"
        import {useDigitalOutputState} from "@glowbuzzer/store"

        export const ToggleDigitalOutputTile = () => {
            const [dout, setDout] = useDigitalOutputState(1) // use the 2nd digital output

            function handle_state_change() {
                const new_state = !dout.setValue // toggle
                setDout(new_state, true) // set new state (and override any existing state)
            }

            return (
                <Tile title="Tutorial Digital Output Toggle">
                    <Space>
                        Toggle my digital output
                        <Switch checked={dout.setValue} onChange={handle_state_change}/>
                    </Space>
                </Tile>
            )
        }
        ```

        Now you can add the new tile to `App.tsx`:

        ```tsx
        // App.tsx
        <nav>
            <ConnectTile/>
            <ToggleDigitalOutputTile/>
            <JogTile/>
            <CartesianDroTile/>
            <FeedRateTile/>
        </nav>
        ```

        You should see the new tile appear in the left hand column underneath the connect tile in your &fe.

        Ensure you are connected to &gbc and that operation is enabled. When you slide the switch &gbc will receive the instruction to set or clear the digital output. In simulation mode,
        digital output 1 is echoed in digital input 1, so you should see the digital inputs tile change, with the second input bit
        being toggled.

        Congratulations, you've created your first bit of custom &fe!
    </Tabs.TabPane>
    <Tabs.TabPane tab="Oscillating Move Tutorial" key="tut2">
        The next example shows how easy it is to write a React machine control that makes a drive move. In this example we will make a drive perform an oscillating move.

        We assume you have completed the first tutorial to toggle a digital output and that you already have your &fe and &gbc running.

        Create `OscillatingMoveTile.tsx` and add the following code:

        ```tsx
        // OscillatingMoveTile.tsx
        import * as React from "react"
        import {useState} from "react";
        import {Button, Space} from "antd";
        import {MotorDro, Tile} from "@glowbuzzer/controls";
        import {useJoint, useSoloActivity} from '@glowbuzzer/store';

        const END = 200;

        export const OscillatingMoveTile = () => {
            const [iteration, setIteration] = useState(0) // keep track of iterations
            const soloActivity = useSoloActivity(0) // request solo activity api for first kinematics configuration
            const joint = useJoint(0) // request joint 0 status

            async function start_moves() {
                // perform same oscillating move 5 times
                for (let n = 0; n < 5; n++) {
                    setIteration(n + 1)
                    await soloActivity.moveJoints([END]).promise()
                    await soloActivity.moveJoints([0]).promise()
                }
                // reset after a few seconds
                setTimeout(() => setIteration(0), 3000)
            }

            return (
                <Tile title="Tutorial Oscillating Move">
                    <Space>
                        <Space direction="vertical" align="center">
                            <Button onClick={start_moves} disabled={!!iteration}>Start Move</Button>
                            {iteration > 0 ? <div>
                                Iteration {iteration}
                            </div> : "Click to start!"}
                        </Space>
                        <MotorDro width={100} value={joint.actPos / END * 360}/>
                    </Space>
                </Tile>
            )
        }
        ```

        Now you can add the new tile to `App.tsx`:

        ```tsx
        // App.tsx
        <nav>
            <ConnectTile/>
            <OscillatingMoveTile/>
            <JogTile/>
            <CartesianDroTile/>
            <FeedRateTile/>
        </nav>
        ```

        You should see the new tile appear in the left hand column underneath the connect tile in your &fe.

        Ensure you are connected to &gbc and that operation is enabled. When you click the start button you should see the motor graphic `MotorDro` move back
        and forth five times, and the iteration count increase.

        Congratulations, you've made a motor move from a React app!
