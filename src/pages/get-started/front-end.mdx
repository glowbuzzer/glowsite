## Introduction
This page takes you though installing the &gbt React components (&gbr) and creating a simple machine control &fe of your own.

We assume you have already covered [running &gbc in simulation mode](/get-started/simulation). The instructions below assume you are running &gbc in simulation mode (without hardware),
but you can also run your custom &fe against one of the hardware starter kits with very few changes.

## Use the glowbuzzer React template to create your project

We provide a custom template as a useful starting point for your project. This helps reduce setup and
configuration work needed to get started. You should perform these steps on your development workstation (Windows or Linux or WSL).

You need Node.js and the Node package manager (npm). We recommend version 16 or above.
If you don't have Node.js installed, [visit the Node.js website for instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Execute the following command to create the project from the &gb template:

```shell
npx create-glowbuzzer-app
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to install packages and start the app. When you run the `start` command, a local development server
is started which will serve the React application. This can be accessed on localhost, on port 5173 by default, for
example: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

You can now open this project in your preferred IDE and start editing (with hot reload enabled).

## Simple tutorials

<PageVariantProvider variants={["tut1", "tut2"]}>

&gbrl provides a docking layout framework you can use to provide a consistent look to your front-ends. Within the docking layout are tiles,
either provided by &gb or ones you develop yourselves. The tiles
are regular React components, so you don't have to use the docking layout if not needed. Note that full source code for all our tiles is
[available on Github](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/tree/main/libs/controls) so you can pick apart
our components and re-package them however you need.

We are going to walk through two different scenarios:

Setting a digital output

: Adds a new tile that contains a toggle button that when clicked will toggle a digital output

Oscillating a joint

: Adds a new tile that runs an oscillating move on a single joint and provides visual feedback

<PageVariantTabs>
    <Tabs.TabPane tab="Digital Output Tutorial" key="tut1">
        Let's create the simplest possible machine control function. A button to toggle a digital output. This is the "hello world" equivalent in automation land.

        First verify that you can run the React project you just created and can connect to &gbc.
        You should be able to start &gbc using the generic configuration, that is by running:
        ```shell
        ./GBC --config ../configs/config_generic.json
        ```

        If you are unable to run &gbc, please follow the [Getting Started](./simulation) instructions.

        Adding a tile involves creating a new React component and then adding it to the docking layout.

        Edit `src/index.tsx` and add the new React component which will render the tile content:

        ```js
        // index.tsx
        const ToggleDigitalOutputTile = () => {
            const [dout, setDout] = useDigitalOutputState(1) // use the 2nd digital output

            function handle_state_change() {
                const new_state = !dout.setValue // toggle
                setDout(new_state, true) // set new state (and override any existing state)
            }

            return (
                <div>
                    <Space>
                        Toggle my digital output
                        <Switch checked={dout.setValue} onChange={handle_state_change} />
                    </Space>
                </div>
            )
        }
        ```

        Next, use `DockTileDefinitionBuilder` to create a docking layout tile definition for the new component:

        ```tsx
        const toggleDigitalOutputTileDefinition = DockTileDefinitionBuilder()
            .id("toggle-digital-output")
            .name("Toggle Digital Output")
            .placement(1, 0)
            .render(() => <ToggleDigitalOutputTile />)
            .build()
        ```

        Finally, replace the full set of standard tiles in the Create React App template with the new tile, plus the required Connect tile:

        ```tsx
        <DockLayoutProvider
            appName={"myapp"}
            tiles={[ConnectTileDefinition, toggleDigitalOutputTileDefinition]}
        >
            <Menu mode="horizontal" theme="light" selectedKeys={[]}>
                <DockViewMenu />
            </Menu>
            <DockLayout />
        </DockLayoutProvider>
        ```

        You should now see the new tile appear in the right hand column next to the connect tile in your &fe.

        Ensure you are connected to &gbc and that operation is enabled. When you slide the switch &gbc will receive the instruction to set or clear the digital output.

        Congratulations, you've created your first bit of custom &fe!
    </Tabs.TabPane>
    <Tabs.TabPane tab="Oscillating Move Tutorial" key="tut2">
        This example shows how easy it is to write a React machine control that makes a drive move. In this example we will make a drive perform an oscillating move.

        We assume you have completed the first tutorial to toggle a digital output and that you already have your &fe and &gbc running.

        Create `OscillatingMoveTile.tsx` and add the following code:

        ```tsx
        // OscillatingMoveTile.tsx
        import * as React from "react"
        import {useState} from "react";
        import {Button, Space} from "antd";
        import {MotorDro, DockTileDefinitionBuilder} from "@glowbuzzer/controls";
        import {useJoint, useSoloActivity} from '@glowbuzzer/store';

        const END = 200;

        const OscillatingMoveTile = () => {
            const [iteration, setIteration] = useState(0) // keep track of iterations
            const soloActivity = useSoloActivity(0) // request solo activity api for first kinematics configuration
            const joint = useJoint(0) // request joint 0 status

            async function start_moves() {
                // perform same oscillating move 5 times
                for (let n = 0; n < 5; n++) {
                    setIteration(n + 1)
                    await soloActivity.moveJoints([END]).promise()
                    await soloActivity.moveJoints([0]).promise()
                }
                // reset after a few seconds
                setTimeout(() => setIteration(0), 3000)
            }

            return (
                <div>
                    <Space>
                        <Space direction="vertical" align="center">
                            <Button onClick={start_moves} disabled={!!iteration}>Start Move</Button>
                            {iteration > 0 ? <div>
                                Iteration {iteration}
                            </div> : "Click to start!"}
                        </Space>
                        <MotorDro width={100} value={joint.actPos / END * 360}/>
                    </Space>
                </Tile>
            )
        }

        export const OscillatingMoveTileDefinition = DockTileDefinitionBuilder()
            .id("oscillating-move")
            .name("Oscillating Move")
            .placement(1, 0)
            .render(() => <OscillatingMoveTile />)
            .build()
        ```

        Now you can add import the new tile and add it to the docking layout in `index.tsx`:

        ```tsx
        // index.tsx
        <DockLayoutProvider
            appName={"myapp"}
            tiles={[ConnectTileDefinition, OscillatingMoveTileDefinition]}
        >
            <Menu mode="horizontal" theme="light" selectedKeys={[]}>
                <DockViewMenu />
            </Menu>
            <DockLayout />
        </DockLayoutProvider>
        ```

        You should see the new tile appear in the right hand column next to the connect tile in your &fe.

        Ensure you are connected to &gbc and that operation is enabled. When you click the start button you should see the motor graphic `MotorDro` move back
        and forth five times, and the iteration count increase.

        Congratulations, you've made a motor move from a React app!
