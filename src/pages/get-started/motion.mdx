## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have:

- [Run the generic simulation and know how to connect the demo front-end to GBC](/get-started/simulation)
- [Assembled the single axis starter kit](/get-started/kits/single-axis)

{/*
## Step 1 - Use the create react app custom template to create your getting started project

The easiest way to start is to use our hosted version of &gbr from our website.

The generic demo (a cartesian machine with 3-axes and an auxiliary axis) is <a href="https://preview.glowbuzzer.com/examples/generic/index.html">available here</a> and is suitable for using with the starter kit hardware.

You will not be able to use the front-end until you have installed &gbc, the real-time control on your PC.

For use with real hardware this needs to run on Linux with real-time extensions. The easiest way to get started with this is to use the &pi but of course you can use a desktop version of Linux.

## Install &pi OS

To run &gbc and &gbem you need a &pi with a preempt patched kernel, in order to eliminate jitter.

The easiest way to install this is to use our image, which you can download from `https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/pi-rt-image.img.z`.
We do provide [instructions on how to build the kernel yourself](/docs/gbem/compiling_and_running) if you feel inclined.

The image needs to be written to a 32Gb SD card. Uncompress the downloaded image either with a Linux `uncompress` command or using the Windows tools.
On Windows write the image to the SD card using [Win32 Disk imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher). On Linux, do a web search for
"Writing an SD Card Image Using Linux Command Line Tools" and follow the instructions from a good source.

Once the SD is ready, you can insert the card in the SD card slot on your &pi and power it up.

If all is well, log onto the &pi with ssh:

```shell
ssh root@rpi-gb
```

The default hostname of image is `gb-rpi` and the password is `raspberry`

## Download and run &gbc

We provide the &gbc binaries for the &pi for evaluation. Other platforms can be supplied on request.

Log in to the &pi, download and run &gbc:

````shell
wget https://downloads.glowbuzzer.com/releases/gbc/rpi/refs/tags/&gbc_version;/gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
tar -xzf gbc-&gbc_version;.tgz
cd &gbc_version.tgz
./GBC --config machine_starter_kit_1.json
````

&gbc will start and listen for connections on port 9000.

## Download, compile and run &gbem

<InstallGBEM>
    Edit `gbem/libs/machine_mapping/inc/map_config.h` to activate the starter kit configuration. Set `MACHINE_SK1` to
    `1` and all others to `0`:

    ````shell
    #define MACHINE_SK1 1
    ````
</InstallGBEM>

Check that &gbem can connect to the slaves on your EtherCAT network:

````shell
./gbem -n -ieth0
````

This prints a lot of detailed diagnostic information, and within this you should see the details of the slaves on the network.

You are now ready to run &gbem:
```
./GBEM -c -ieth0
```

## Launch and connect the front-end

The simplest way to launch a front-end is to use the generic demo hosted on the &gb website, as you did in the [Quick Start](/get-started/simulation) section.

<ArrowRightOutlined/> [Launch the generic demo front-end](http://preview.glowbuzzer.com/examples/generic/index.html)

In the demo application:
- Modify the connection url using the Preferences button at the top of the page
- Connect
- Clear the initial fault
- Enable operation

You are now ready to start jogging.

## Jog a motor
