    - Use the getting started hardware to get a drive moving
    - Commission an EtherCAT master
    - Use the web-front-end to jog the drives
    - Interact with the EtherCAT IO
</Tldr>

<Alert message="Caution" description="This guide assumes you are working with the single axis EtherCAT starter kit hardware and it have it fully assembled" type="warning" showIcon style={{margin: '20px 0 20px 0'}} />


## Step 1 - Use the create react app custom template to create your getting started project

<CraTemplate/>

## Step 2 - install Raspberry Pi OS

<InstallPi/>

## Step 3 - Download GBC on the Raspberry Pi

<InstallGBC/>

## Step 4 - Download GBEM configure it for the test machine hardware

<InstallGBEM/>

Then open in your IDE the following file:

`map config.h` file which lives in `libs/inc/machine_mapping`. Here you to set the machine #define to be equal to the machine you are using.

In the file there will be a #define matching you starter kit.

````shell
#define MACHINE_STARTERKIT_1        0
#define MACHINE_STARTERKIT_2        0
````

Set the matching #define to `1` and make sure all the others are set to `0`.

## Step 5 - Run GBC & GBEM and make sure it connected to both GBC and the test hardware

Run GBC:

<RunGbc/>

And then run GBEM:

<RunGbem/>

## Step 6 - Connect the browser to GBC

<FrontendConnect/>

## Step 6 - Jog a motor!
