## Step 1 - Use the create react app custom template to create your getting started project

You will perform this step on your PC (Windows or Linux or WSL).

```shell
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template [gb-starter]
cd your-project-name
npm start
```

If that completes successfully, that is it for this step.

## Step 2 - install Raspberry Pi OS

We need a Raspberry Pi with a preempt patched kernel on which to run the core control. The front-end React application will talk to this over web-sockets.

The easiest way to install this is to use our image.

Download from `https://download.glowbuzzer.com/pi-rt-image.img.z`

(We do provide instructions on how to build the kernel yourself if your feel inclined - see <Link to="/docs/gbem/compiling_and_running"> here.</Link>)

Next, uncompress the downloaded image either with a Linux `uncompress` command or using the Windows tools.

Next, the 32gb SD card must have the image written to it. On Windows use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">Win32 Disk imager</a> or <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/"> Etcher</a>.

On Linux, google "Writing an SD Card Image Using Linux Command Line Tools" and follow the instructions from a good source.

Once the image is written, you can plug in to your Raspberry Pi and the power it up.

If all is well, log onto the pi with ssh:


````shell
ssh root@rpi-gb
````

password - `raspberry`

## Step 3 - Download GBC on the Raspberry Pi
While your are logged into the pi, in your home directory, download GBC from `https://download.glowbuzzer.com/gbc-armv7.tar.xz`.

If `wget` needs installing, install with:
```shell
sudo apt install wget
```
Otherwise, just run:

```shell
wget https://download.glowbuzzer.com/gbc-armv7.tar.gz
```

Then uncompresss with:
```shell
tar -xzf gbc-armv7.tar.gz
```
That's it for this step.

## Step 4 - Download GBEM configure it for the test machine hardware
Download GBEM from GitHub
````shell
git clone https://gitgub.com/glowbuzzer/gbem
````

Open in your IDE and edit the following files:

machine config



````shell
````

## Step 5 - Run GBC & GBEM and make sure it connected to both GBC and the test hardware

Run GBC:
```shell
cd ..
cd GBC
./GBEM -c -ieth0
```

And then run GBEM:

````shell
cd GBEM
./GBEM -c -ieth0
````
You should see lots of output but xxxx is the key

## Step 6 - Connect the browser to GBC

First, run `npm start` in the directory into which you CRA React application is located.

Then, connect your browser, to the React dev server with:

`localhost:4000`

(adjust the port as needed)

Then click connect in the glowbuzzer generic application:
