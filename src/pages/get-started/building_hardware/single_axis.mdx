# Assembling the single axis starter kit

<Alert message="Caution!" description="All mains voltage wiring must be done in accordance with the rules and regulations of your region and your company's standards. We provide no guidance how to accomplish this." type="error" showIcon style={{margin: '20px 0 20px 0'}} />

## Tools required

* Wire cutters - e.g. Kinpex 78 61 125
* Crimping pliers - e.g. <a href="https://www.rennsteig.com/en/products/crimping/198-ferrule-crimping-tool-pew-8-184-8-185-8-186"> Rennsteig 610 186 3</a>
* Screwdriver - Blade (Bar) 2.5 x 0.4mm e.g. Wago 210-719

Time required = 30 minutes

## Wiring the Oriental Motor Drive

The drive requires two 24V connections: one for the motor power and one for the logic power.

The larger MDR-100-24 power supply is used for the motor power and the smaller MDR-20-24 power supply is used for the logic power.

The power cables for motor power is a pre-assembled cable from Oriental motor. The ends of this cable must be crimped with bootlace ferrules. This will mean cutting off the ring terminals and crimping them with a bootlace ferrule.

For the logic power 0.5mm2 wires are needed. The ends of these wires must be crimped.


CN4 -Motor power - 24v 0v earth
CN1 - 24v 0v

Motor power connects directly to the MDR-100-24 power supply's 24v/0v terminals.
Logic power connects directly to the MDR-20-24 power supply's terminals.

Logic power can be routed via a Wago terminal blocks if you want access to 24V and 0V for IO.

Mains power needs to be safely provided to the power supplies through any filters and protection devices that you or your local regulations may deem appropriate and with any additional secondary mechanical elctrical protection.
