## Tools required  <ToolOutlined/>

* Wire cutters - e.g. <a href="https://www.knipex.com/en-uk/products/electronics-pliers/electronic-super-knips/electronic-super-knips/7861125">Knipex 78 61 125</a>
* Crimping pliers - e.g. <a href="https://www.rennsteig.com/en/products/crimping/198-ferrule-crimping-tool-pew-8-184-8-185-8-186"> Rennsteig 610 186 3</a>
* Screwdriver - Blade (Bar) 2.5 x 0.4mm e.g. Wago 210-719

## Time required <ClockCircleOutlined/>
Around 30 minutes


## Mount the components on the DIN rail
Start by mounting the following components on the provided DIN rail:
* AZD3A-KED drive
* MDR-100-24 PSU
* MDR-20-24 PSU
* Beckhoff EK1100, EL1008, EL2008
* Wago terminal blocks

The Beckhoff IO consists of the EK1100, EL1008, EL2008. These clip together to form a unit.


We chose to mount the DIN rails to a perspex base board but this isn't of course needed for prototyping.

When placed on the DIN rails your assembly should look something like this:

import three_axis_components_on_rail from "./three_axis_components_on_rail.jpg?glowsite"

<Image meta={three_axis_components_on_rail} alt="Three axis components on rail"/>

## Crimp the power cables for the AZD3A-KED drive

Next, the power cables for the AZD3A-KED need to be crimped. Insulated crimps can be used for these.

import three_axis_azd_power_cables from "./three_axis_azd_power_cables.jpg?glowsite"

<Image meta={three_axis_azd_power_cables} alt="AZD power cables" maxWidth={400}/>

## Connect the AZD drive power to the PSUs

Next, this power cables are connected to the AZD3A-KED's power connectors.

CN1 is the motor power supply and this is wired directly to the larger MDR-100-24 PSU.

CN2 is the logic power supply and this is wired though some jumpered Wago terminal blocks to smaller MDR-20-24 PSU.

import three_axis_azd_wiring from "./three_axis_azd_wiring.jpg?glowsite"

<Image meta={three_axis_azd_wiring} alt="Three axis AZD wiring"/>

## Connect the Beckhoff IO power suppliers

The next step is connect the power supply to the Beckhoff EK1100.

Some 1mm^2 wires are cut to the right length and are crimped with insulated bootlace ferrules.

The EK1100 needs two power supplies, one for its own power (Coupler power supply) and the other to power the bus to the other terminals (Power contacts supply).

The wiring is detailed in the following diagram.

import ek1100 from "./EK1100.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={ek1100} maxWidth="600" alt={"EK1100 product image"}/>

Both of these supplies connect to the smaller MDR-20-24 PSU via the Wago terminal blocks.

The completed wiring is shown in the following diagram.

import three_axis_beckhoff_wiring from "./three_axis_beckhoff_wiring.jpg?glowsite"

<Image meta={three_axis_beckhoff_wiring} alt="Three axis Beckhoff wiring"/>

## Connect the motors and EtherCAT connector

The next step is to connect the motors and connect the EtherCAT network between the components.

This is shown in the next photograph.

import three_axis_motors_and_ethercat from "./three_axis_motors_and_ethercat.jpg?glowsite"

<Image meta={three_axis_motors_and_ethercat} alt="Three axis Beckhoff wiring"/>

The Raspberry Pi RJ45 network connection is connected to the spare RJ45 connector on the EK1100.

## Completed starter kit

So your completed starter kit will look like this:

import photo_three_axis_start_kit_assembled from "../photo_three_axis_start_kit_assembled.jpg?glowsite"

<Image meta={photo_three_axis_start_kit_assembled} alt="Completed Three axis starter kit"/>

If your power it up, you will be rewarded by lots of flashing LEDs.

The next step is to get a motor moving. See <Link to="/get-started/motion"> here</Link> for details on how to do this.

Also, see <Link to="/docs/gbem/drive_support/om_azd3a_ked"> here</Link> for details on how to use the Oriental Motor MEX02 software to commission the drive and make the motor move.
