## Compiling
On Linux, there is a single executable, &gbem, which is run with a number of command line options.

<InstallGbem/>

To do any substantial development with &gbem, the code will need to be imported into your IDE of choice (for example [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion) ).

The provided `CMakeLists.txt` files provides a basis for IDEs that use CMake but the code is simple and should be easy to import into any IDE/build system.

## Command line options

The main command line modes are:

1. cyclic `-c` - run &gbem in cyclic mode (normal)
1. netscan `-n` - run &gbem in netscan mode (**without** applying PDO mapping)
1. netscan `-m` - run &gbem in netscan mode (**with** applying PDO mapping
1. machine config - `-d` - run &gbem to check and print machine configuration
1. version - `-v` - print version of &gbem
1. write - `-w` - write a set of SDOs and trigger a write to slave's NVRAM
1. interface - `-i` - interface to use - this is a NIC interface, for example, eth0
1. process - `-p` - the process name to send signals to

Normally, you will run &gbem with: `./GBEM -c -ieth0`. Obviously, change `eth0` to the name of the network interface connected to the EtherCAT network.

When you want to scan the EtherCAT network you will run &gbem with: `./GBEM -n -i eth0`.

## Console output from &gbem

When &gbem runs, the first thing you should see is the welcome messages.

```text
[INFO  ] GBEM: **************************************************************************
[INFO  ] GBEM: ***                     Starting GB EtherCAT Master                    ***

[INFO  ] GBEM: ***                           Debug info.                              ***
[INFO  ] GBEM: **************************************************************************
[INFO  ] GBEM: Debug logging is globally enabled (ENABLE_LOGGING)

[INFO  ] GBEM: **************************************************************************

[INFO  ] GBEM: **************************************************************************
[INFO  ] GBEM: Software project name [GBEM]
[INFO  ] GBEM: Software project version [0.0.1]

```

&gbem will then try and connect to &gbc. If &gbc is not running you will see warning messages like:

```text
[WARN  ] PID: Failed to read line using popen (we can't find a Linux process that matches the name [GBC])
```

or

```text
GBEM: Connection to shared memory & GBC process could not be established - we will continue without a connection to GBC
```


So make sure &gbc is running.

&gbem will confirm what machine target it has been compiled with a console output like this:


```text
GBEM: This code has been compiled for [MY_MACHINE]
```


Next, &gbem will check the machine config for any errors. If you see:

```text
"GBEM: Config checking (and config JSON creation) >failed< .This implies that there is something nasty in either the machine config itself or the process to create it");
```

This means that the checking of the machine config failed. Helpful messages will have been outputted that explain where the issue is. You will need to fix teh config c files and compile again.

Next &gbem (in cyclic mode) will start the boot process.

You will see this banner:

```text
UM_INFO(GBEM_UM_EN, "GBEM: **************************************************************************");
UM_INFO(GBEM_UM_EN, "GBEM: ***                    Start of cyclic boot process                    ***");
UM_INFO(GBEM_UM_EN, "GBEM: **************************************************************************");
```

The boot steps are as follows:

1. Initialise hardware (the Ethernet NIC used for EtherCAT communications)
1. Enumerate and initialise all slaves
1. Move all slaves to PRE_OP state
1. In the PO-to-SO hooks
    1. Apply PDO mapping
    1. Apply standard SDOs
    1. Apply DC settings
1. Check for errors
1. Move all slaves to SAFE_OP state (check that all slaves have reach SAFE_OP)
1. Check the workcounter actual matches expected
1. Check slaves match (check that the slaves on the network match the type and order you have them in your machine config files)
1. Move all slave to OP state

If all the slaves make it through all these steps then you are up and running!

Any failure at any step will result in an error message and the boot process will re-try.


## Running with a real-time connection to the EtherCAT network

This assumes you have:

* &gbem installed on a Linux platform with a preempted kernel
* Have the correct NIC connected to an EtherCAT network with one or more slaves on it which are powered up
* Have configured a machine see <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/gbem/configuring_machines">Configuring machines</GlowsiteLink>

Start out by doing a netscan. This is `./gbem -n -i eth0`.

This will send out on the EtherCAT network a BRD (Broadcast Read) of address 0, and all functional slaves in the network will respond to this request.

The netscan will either produce an error message ðŸ˜• or a blizzard of config information â€‹ðŸ™‚.â€‹

If you get an error message then it is time to read the troubleshooting guide. If you have found some slaves, the next step is check the machine config by running `./gbem -d -i th0`. This will either confirm that the machine configuration is valid or will produce error messages explaining where the misconfiguration lies.

Finally, you can run &gbem in cyclic mode with `./gbem -c -i eth0`. This will boot the EtherCAT network and then try and connect over shared memory to &gbc (or a program you write to control &gbem over shared memory).

## &gbem config

**`gbem_config.h` & `map_config.h`**

As well as the configuration for machines and the configuration and code for drives and slaves, &gbem has three config files:

`gbem_config.h` contains  compile time #defines it is well commented and self-explanatory

`map_config.h`contains the #defines to control which machine target &gbem is being compiled for and some #defines for things like the maximum length of drive error messages

Unless the `map_config.h` has the correct machine configuration enabled, and that machine configuration matches the slaves on the EtherCAT network GBEM will fail to boot.

## ramdisk directory

If running on Linux platforms that use an SD card or eMMC as its filesystem, and you want to use emstat. (<GlowsiteLink to="/docs/gbem/emstat">emstat documentation</GlowsiteLink>) provides more details.to write a JSON file each containing that status of the &gbem then it is useful to store files in RAM based storage rather than on storage that may have limited write/cycles.

To do this under Linux, first create a mount point:

```shell
sudo mkdir /mnt/ramdisk
```

Then, we need to enter it in `/etc/fstab`, so that a RAM disk is automatically generated upon start-up. So, edit the `fstab` file

````shell
sudo nano /etc/fstab
````

In the file add the line:

````shell
tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk tmpfs nodev,nosuid,size=50M 0 0
````

This allows you to save 50 MB of data to `/mnt/ramdisk`. After a restart, you can use the following command to confirm the disk has been created and its size.

````shell
sudo df -h
````

## Preempt-RT kernel patching

&gbem needs a low latency kernel. The Linux preempt-RT kernel patch can provide this.

These instructions perform a **cross-compile** i.e. the kernel is compiled on a host and transferred to target. This example is for the Raspberry Pi 4B but a similar approach can be taken for other targets.

So will need to download the Raspbian OS to an SD card for your Pi first. See <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/"> Raspbian installation instructions and software</a>.

If you are using the Raspberry Pi imager software you can use the advance options to set:
* default username and password (traditionally pi:raspberry)
* your hostname
* enable SSH access

Otherwise, once the Pi is un and running, run `sudo raspi-config` and set:
* S1 - wireless settings
* S4 - hostname
* I2 - enable ssh
* I4 - enable SPI


You will also need to enable ssh root access to the Pi with the following:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find the line `#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password` and replace with `PermitRootLogin yes`.


### Download the sources

Create a directory, `rpi_new_kernel` on your PC, and a subdirectory `rpi_rt_kernel` inside that directory for the compiled files as:

```sh
mkdir ~/rpi_new_kernel
cd ~/rpi_new_kernel
mkdir rpi_rt_kernel
```

Then, clone the following repositories:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git -b rpi-4.19.y-rt
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git
```

### Configuration

First install bison and flex and calc with `sudo apt-get install flex bison bc`.

Next set the environment variables needed for the cross-compilation of the kernel:

```sh
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=~/rpi_new_kernel/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-
export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=~/rpi_new_kernel/rpi_rt_kernel
export INSTALL_DTBS_PATH=~/rpi_new_kernel/rpi_rt_kernel
export KERNEL=kernel7l
cd ~/rpi_new_kernel/linux/
make bcm2711_defconfig
```

### Cross compiling the Kernel

To compile the kernel you need to run the following makes:

```sh
make -j8 zImage
make -j8 modules
make -j8 dtbs
make -j8 modules_install
make -j9 dtbs_install
```

The `-jX` parameter is set according to the number of processors that you want to devote to the compile.

The last line returned after installing `modules_install` reports the kernel version that you compiled, for example:

```sh
DEPMOD  4.19.71-rt24-v7l+
```

You'll need this information for the kernel deployment. Then, make just a blob of data at the end of the kernel image typing:

```sh
mkdir $INSTALL_MOD_PATH/boot
./scripts/mkknlimg ./arch/arm/boot/zImage $INSTALL_MOD_PATH/boot/$KERNEL.img
cd $INSTALL_MOD_PATH/boot
mv $KERNEL.img kernel7_rt.img
```


### Transfer the Kernel

After the compilation is completed, compress all files to transfer them to the Raspberry Pi:

```sh
cd $INSTALL_MOD_PATH
tar czf ../rt-kernel.tgz *
```

Then, transfer the resulting '.tgz' file to the Raspberry Pi using `scp` and your ssh credentials:

```sh
~/rpi_new_kernel/rpi_rt_kernel$ cd ..
~/rpi_new_kernel$ scp rt-kernel.tgz pi@<ipaddress>:/tmp
```

Change `<ipaddress>` to the corresponding IP of your Raspberry Pi.

At this stage, `uname -a` will give something like - `Linux raspberrypi 5.15.32-v7l+ #1538 SMP` for the stock raspbian install.


### Installing the Kernel Image, Modules & Device Tree Overlays

```sh
cd /tmp
tar xzf rt-kernel.tgz
cd boot
sudo cp -rd * /boot/
cd ../lib
sudo cp -dr * /lib/
cd ../overlays
sudo cp -d * /boot/overlays
cd ..
sudo cp -d bcm* /boot/
```

Add the following entry to `/boot/config.txt` (`sudo nano /boot/config.txt`):

```sh
# Add the following option:
kernel=kernel7_rt.img
```

Reboot the Raspberry Pi and test if the kernel is working by typing:

```sh
uname -r
4.19.71-rt24-v7l+
```

```sh
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/rt-tests/rt-tests.git`
cd rt-tests
git checkout stable/v1.0
make all -j4
sudo make install
```

Then run with `sudo cyclictest -l50000000 -m -S -p90 -i200 -h400 -q > output.txt`.

Or `sudo cyclictest --mlockall --smp --priority=80 --interval=200 --distance=0`


## Forcing variables

If enabled with the #defines `CTRL_ENABLE_FORCING` (force EtherCAT PDO variables) and PLC_ENABLE_FORCING (force PLC variables) in `GBEM_config.h` you can force the value of a variable using the debugger. Most debuggers/IDEs offer the capability to pause the execution of a running program under the debugger and once paused give you the ability to change the value of a variable whilst the code is executing under the debugger.

In the following screen-shot (taken from the JetBrains CLion IDE) shows that we have navigated to our machine map .c file whilst the debugger is paused and clicked on the `map_iomap[]` variable and then navigated to the line in the iomap we want to force and can set a value and a Boolean active flag to force the val to our desired value. The value is a union of the available types, so you will need to select the one that corresponds to type you want to force.

import forcing_a_variable from "./forcing_a_variable.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={forcing_a_variable} alt="Forcing a variable in the IDE" preset="wide"  />


This is a little clumsy to use, but it does provide an invaluable test/debugging tool in certain situations.
