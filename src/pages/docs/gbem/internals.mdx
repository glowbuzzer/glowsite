## Threads (Linux POSIX pthreads)

When everything is up and running we will have the following threads running:

* ec_rxtx - realtime - `void ECRxTx(void *argument)` 
* ec_emstat - `void ec_emstat(void *argument)`spits out the emstat status.json file every few seconds 
* ec_check - `void ec_check(void *argument)`checks for slaves that are raising errors or have dropped off the network
* n x PLC threads - each PLC task that the user creates becomes a pthread 

## gberror

Simple mechanism to centralise the error codes returned from functions.

If you have a look in `gberror.h` & `gberror.c` you can see the defined error codes returned by functions.

If you are writing your own functions then either use codes from this table or add your own new ones.

## Signals

The main &gbem ec_rxtx thread runs in real-time and at whatever frequency you have defined as your bus cycle, will send a signal to process defined in the &gbem configuration.


## Slave numbering

&gbem numbers slaves based on their physical position on the network.

Slave numbers start at 1 and each of the following slaves have an incremented slave number.

Using the `netscan` function of &gbem will help you identify your slave numbers if there is any confusion.

## CiA 402 state machine

&gbem uses the CiA 402 state machine extensively in its operation.

import cia_402 from "./cia402.svg"

<img className="bg-light" src={cia_402} width="100%" alt={"CiA 402 state machine"}/>

&gbem has the concept of the **machine state**. This is a CiA 402 state machine and is commanded by &gbc and reports back its status to &gbc over shared memory (DPM) in the status word. These words are accessed through:
`dpm_in->machine_word` & `dpm_out->machine_word`.

If &gbc commands &gbem (by writing to shared memory) to move from `CIA_SWITCH_ON_DISABLED` to `CIA_READY_TO_SWITCH_ON`
with a `CIA_SHUTDOWN` control word, &gbem will try and advance the **machine state** to `CIA_READY_TO_SWITCH_ON`. To do this, &gbem will command all drives to also move to the `CIA_READY_TO_SWITCH_ON` state and if they succeed in making the transition and there are no active faults, then the **machine state** will advance and `CIA_READY_TO_SWITCH_ON` will be reported in the machine word.

The **machine state** implements the full CiA 402 state machine as illustrated in the cia402_diagram.

## Interface between &gbem & &gbc

### Introduction

The interface between &gbc is very simple. It consists of two things:

1. 200 bytes x 2 (In and Out) of dual port memory (shared mem)
1. A signal (POSIX) sent synchronously from &gbem to &gbc each busy cycle to trigger a cycle of execution

The IN and OUT global buffers are:
* storage : `in`
* struct overlay : `dpm_in_t` & `dpm_out_t` in `dpm.c`

&gbem needs to know the Process ID (PID) of &gbc in order to send signals to it. There is a default process name #pr? and it can be specified optionally on the &gbem command line -p[name].

### dpm_in

Key things that can be seen in these structs are:

```c
typedef struct {
uint32_t machine_word;
uint32_t active_fault_word;
uint32_t fault_history_word;
uint32_t  heartbeat;
uint16_t  joint_statusword[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];
int32_t joint_actual_position[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];
int32_t joint_actual_velocity[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];
int32_t joint_actual_torque[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];;
uint64_t digital;
float analog[DPM_NUM_ANALOGS];
int32_t  integer32[DPM_NUM_INT32S];
uint8_t reserved[4];
uint32_t unsigned32[DPM_NUM_UINT32S];
}__attribute__((packed)) dpm_in_t;
```

`machine word` - this follows the CiA 402 pattern and is sent by &gbc to &gbem to advance its overall "machine" state machine. As the main &gbem state machine advances, &gbem automatically commands all drives to try and follow its state machine i.e. if you set the `machine_word` to `OPERATION_ENABLED` then &gbem will try and advance all drives to `OPERATION_ENABLED`.

`heartbeat` - &gbem generates a heartbeat tick which is echo'd by &gbc if this does not keep up it will trigger an error on &gbem.

### dpm_out

```c
typedef struct {
uint32_t machine_word;
uint32_t hlc_control_word;
uint32_t gbc_control_word;
uint32_t  heartbeat;
uint16_t  joint_controlword[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];
int32_t joint_set_position[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];
int32_t joint_set_velocity[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];
int32_t joint_set_torque[DPM_NUM_JOINTS];;
uint64_t digital;
float analog[DPM_NUM_ANALOGS];
int32_t  integer32[DPM_NUM_INT32S];
uint8_t reserved[4];
uint32_t unsigned32[DPM_NUM_UINT32S];
}__attribute__((packed)) dpm_out_t;
```





## logger
&gbem contains a little logging framework.

In the `main.c` function, it can be set to output messages to file, console (stdout) or syslog by uncommenting the correct line here:

```
logger_set_stdout();
//    logger_set_log_file("gbem.log", LOG_EN);
//    logger_set_syslog("Glowbuzzer");
```
