    - Using the recommended hardware is the easiest way to get started
    - Next easiest is to use a combination of the slaves/drives we already support
    - Writing slave and drive interfaces is not hard to supporting any EtherCAT device is not hard
</Tldr>

If you are using the recommended starter hardware, a guide to getting a drive moving can be found here: <GlowsiteLink to="/get-started/qs-hardware">Quick-start - with hardware</GlowsiteLink>.

If you are using your own hardware then the basic steps (if you are using a Raspberry Pi as the test Linux platform) are:


Start by following the instructions as if you are using one the starter kits - <GlowsiteLink to="/get-started/qs-hardware">Quick-start - with hardware</GlowsiteLink>.

Then you will need to make changes to the &gbem code to support your specific machine.

This is done with the following steps:

1. Step 1 - if your slaves and drives are currently supported by &gbem you just need to configure a machine in &gbem - see <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/gbem/configuring_machines"> Configuring machines in GBEM</GlowsiteLink>
1. Step 2 - if you need to write new slave code - see <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/gbem/adding_a_new_slave"> Adding a new slave in GBEM</GlowsiteLink>
1. Step 3 - if you need to write new drive code - see <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/gbem/adding_a_new_drive"> Adding a new drive in GBEM</GlowsiteLink>


Then you will be able to complete the <GlowsiteLink to="/get-started/qs-hardware">Quick-start - with hardware</GlowsiteLink> instructions by jogging a motor on the machine you confgured.
