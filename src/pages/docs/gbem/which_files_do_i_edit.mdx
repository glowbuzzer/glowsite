## Adding new machines using existing slaves and drives

If you are looking to configure a new machine (using slaves and drives that you have defined) then you are going to be working in the `/libs/machine_mapping` static lib.

You will create two files for your machine to hold your machine configuration:

` /libs/machine_mapping/inc/my_machine_map.h` 

` /libs/machine_mapping/src/my_machine_map.c`

And in `/libs/machine_mapping/inc/map_config.h` you will add in a new #define for your new machine.

`/libs/machine_mapping/inc/map_config.h` is where there is a single location to switch between machines you have defined.

This is very useful in development where you might have different test machines, or different machines in different places you work and want to easily swap between them.

Also in `/libs/machine_mapping/inc/map_config.h` you have to complete a set of conditional includes to include the header file for your machine.

Also in `/libs/machine_mapping/src/map_config.c` & `/libs/machine_mapping/inc/map_config.h` also are where the names of machines are stored which are used to print to console the name of the machine at GBEM start-up (very useful when you are developing to make sure you are working with the right machine!).

## Adding a new drive

If you are adding a new drive (one which is not supported already), you will create a new static library.

We tend to use a directory per manufacturer.

This will be for example, `/libs/my_drive_mfr`.

You will need to add a CMakeLists.txt to this - or add to your build system if not using cmake.

Adding a new drive requires at least a .c and .h file containing the code for your drive. These should be named after the model of the drive. E.g. `libs/my_drive_mfr/my_drive_model.c`.

The header file you create will need to include in your `my_machine_map.h` file.

## Adding new slaves

If you are adding a new slave (one which is not supported already), you will create a new static library.

We tend to use a directory per manufacturer.

This will be for example, `/libs/my_slave_mfr`

You will need to add a CMakeLists.txt to this - or add to your build system if not using cmake.

Adding a new slave requires at least a .c and .h file containing the code for your slave. These should be named after the model of the slave. E.g. `libs/my_slave_mfr/my_slave_model.c`.

The header file you create will need to include in your `my_machine_map.h` file.

## Changing general config

General GBEM configuration options are contained in:

`/apps/GEBM/shared/inc/gbem_config.h`

Some options are configurable from with the CMake build system - see `gbem_defs_linux.cmake`.
