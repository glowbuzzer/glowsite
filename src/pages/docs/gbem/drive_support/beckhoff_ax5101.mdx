## Introduction

This short guide reviews the Beckhoff AX5101 drive and discusses how to get it working with GBEM.

AX5000 drives are available with current capacities from 1.5 A to 170 A. They are a sophisticated EtherCAT servo drives.

The drives have a nice feature that they support a wide range of input voltages - 1 x 100 VAC - 1 x
240 VAC - 3 x 100 VAC - 3 x 480 VAC.

They have built in interfaces to the common encoder interfaces (Sin/Cos, EnDAT, Hiperface, BiSS, Resolver etc.)

??Range of encoder option cards EnDat 2.1 , Hiperface , BiSS B , SinCos 1 Vpp , Resolver, EnDat 2.2 , BiSS C


The AX-Bridge quick-connect system is pretty handy to speed and tidy up the connection for multiple axes.

Beckhoff also do dual channel drives in the series.

The smallest AX5101 drive is £1200 roughly.

In multi-axis systems the drives can be coupled in the DC link, so that they can exchange energy



itec plugs or m23 speedtec on motors

nice te connectivity connectors - they are just about diy wireabled but you need a couple of the TE connectivity crimp tool which is made of solid gold and costs a billion euros. beckhoff a bit funny with warranty when using your own custom cables

 nice accessories motor chokes,

abs mutiturn encoders

electromagnetic brake options

bit limited on shaft options


This range of motors has been developed by Fertig in a joint-venture between Beckhoff and ex. ELAU people so, you would expect they really know what they are doing.

The drives offer the Beckhoff "OCT One Cable Technology". Which while we can't consider combining the motor power and encoder cables as revolutionary, it is pretty handy to have a single connector on motors not the usual two.


The drives use the Beckhoff AM8xxx series motors with flanges from 40 mm to 194 mm and  torque 0.2 Nm to 129Nm
