## Introduction

This short guide reviews the Beckhoff EL2522 terminal and discusses how to get it working with GBEM.

The EL2522 is a Beckhoff IO terminal that performs incremental encoder simulation. This means it outputs a frequency modulated signal (for example step/direction) that can be used to control motor drivers.

Each terminal can support two outputs. The outputs can be step/direction or an encoder simulation signal.

The EL2522 supports an enhanced operating mode which allows continuous positioning with output pulses that cycle-synchronously. This means we can cyclically write a position to the device and it will output pulses to reflect that position updating its internal counter to reflect position.

*This terminal is useful, if for example, we have a driver for a motor that supports step/direction that we want to use with our control.*

The output stage allows a maximum frequency of 500 kHz to be output. 500kHz when used with a 200 steps / rev  motor = 2500 rps = 150k rpm. 500kHz when used with a 200 steps / rev motor and the drive is using 128 microstepping = 20 rps = 1200 rpm. So the 500KHz is sufficient for most usage scenarios.

## Startup SDOs
The following SDOs are needed to be applied at startup to configure the drive:

<SdoCard name="Operating mode - CH1" index="0x8000" subindex="0x0e" value="1" notes="1 is pulse/dir"/>
<SdoCard name="Operating mode - CH2" index="0x8010" subindex="0x0e" value="1" notes="1 is pulse/dir"/>
<SdoCard name="Base frequency 1 - CH1" index="0x8000" subindex="0x12" value="50000" notes="unit is Hertz"/>
<SdoCard name="Base frequency 1 - CH2" index="0x8010" subindex="0x12" value="50000" notes="unit is Hertz"/>
<SdoCard name="Base frequency 2 - CH1" index="0x8000" subindex="0x13" value="100000" notes="unit is Hertz"/>
<SdoCard name="Base frequency 2 - CH2" index="0x8010" subindex="0x13" value="100000" notes="unit is Hertz"/>
<SdoCard name="Negative logic - CH1" index="0x8000" subindex="0x10" value="100000" />
<SdoCard name="Negative logic - CH2" index="0x8010" subindex="0x10" value="100000" />

## PDO mapping

The default PDO mapping is not suitable for position control. So we will need apply a custom mapping.

Diving into the drive's documentation shows us that the following PDOs will give us position control using 32 bit position registers.



SM2
* 0x1601 - PTO control position channel 1
* 0x1606 - PTO control position channel 2
* 0x160b - ENC control channel 1
* 0x160d - ENC control channel 2

SM3
* 0x1a03 - ENC status channel 1
* 0x1a05 - ENC status channel 2

(PTO = Pulse Train Output)

## Netscan after PDO mapping

We can see that we have very little control of the start-up and enabling of this drive. It starts up in enabled mode.

When you write a value to the `Target counter value` it will output the number of pulses to reach this target. Its internal counter can be read in `Counter value`.

There are two channels available.

## Writing the driver code

GBEM expects drives to follow the CiA 402 state machine and provide an interface that mirrors this standard.

This means we have to write code in our driver software to emulate the CiA 402 statemachine in our driver code. This is not very complicated especially as this drive doesn't have any internal states of its own.

You can see how we do it in the `EL72522.c` file.

## Testing

### Oscilloscope tests

We connected the A+ output of the EL2522's first channel to an oscilloscope. A- (the complimentary output) is left disconnected. The B+ and B- outputs just signal the direction and these were also left disconnected.

First at constant velocity:

import tek_el2522_cv from "./tek_el2522_cv.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={tek_el2522_cv} alt="Oscilloscope CV" />

This is exactly what we would expect. A steady stream of pulses at a frequency that corresponds to our maximum velocity.

Secondly during an acceleration ramp:

import tek_el2522_ramp from "./tek_el2522_ramp.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={tek_el2522_ramp} alt="Oscilloscope ramp" />

Again this is what we would expect. There slight discontinuities in the increase in frequency at around 170ms probably caused by the cyclic setting of position and Beckhoff's algorithm for calculating the frequency for the next period but we wouldn't expect this to be audibly noticeable on the motor but these could cause slight path variation if the drive was used for precision synchronised motion.

### Testing EL2522 + driver + motor

We connected the EL2522 to a generic Chinese stepper motor driver output stage.

The EL2521-0000 has 2 RS422 outputs (A, B) or a single channel (A, B, C) which gives a max. differential voltage of -6V to +6V which works fine with the 5V inputs of the generic stepper output stages.

In step direction mode, channel A becomes step and channel B becomes direction.

These are wired to the output stage's inputs:

* A+ -> PUL+
* A- -> PUL-
* B+ -> DIR+
* B- -> DIR-

import EL2522_wired_with_op_stage from "./EL2522_wired_with_op_stage.jpg?glowsite"

<Image meta={EL2522_wired_with_op_stage} alt="Wired EL2522" />

Here you can see us jogging the EL2522 from the glowbuzzer's toolkit web front-end.
