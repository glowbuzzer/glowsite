## Introduction

This short guide reviews the Beckhoff EL7031 drive and discusses how to get them working with GBEM.

The Beckhoff EL7031 is a EtherCAT terminal that provides a drive for small stepper motors. 

The output stage voltage is fixed at 24V and maximum current of 1.5A (per phase) so you are looking at NEMA 17 and possibly NEMA 23 sized motors.

The terminal has two digital inputs, usually used for limit switches.

Its 64-fold micro-stepping is fixed.

The terminal does not support an encoder.

The terminal has DC support.

## Wiring up

The wiring up the EL7031 could not be much simpler. The motor connects to A1, A2, B1 & B2 and the motor power supply is fed through the terminals power contacts.

So, the simplest set-up for a single stepper motor, is an EK1100 bus coupler with the EL7031 connected to it as follows:

import EK1100_EL7031 from "./EK1100_EL7031.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={EK1100_EL7031} alt="EL7031 wiring"  />

## Startup SDOs

The following SDOs are needed to be applied at startup to configure the drive:

<SdoCard name={"Max current"} index={"0x8010"} subindex={"0x1"} value={"0x5dc (1500)"} notes={"1500=1.5A"} />
<SdoCard name={"Reduced current"} index={"0x8010"} subindex={"0x2"} value={"0x2ee (1356)"} notes={"Current to use when in reduced torque mode"} />
<SdoCard name={"Nominal voltage"} index={"0x8010"} subindex={"0x3"} value={"5dc0 (24000)"} notes={"24000=24V"} />
<SdoCard name={"Motor coil resistance "} index={"0x8010"} subindex={"0x4"} value={"0x64 (100)"} notes={"100 = 100 Ohms - not sure what impact changing this has"} />
<SdoCard name={"Motor full steps"} index={"0x8010"} subindex={"0x6"} value={"0xc8 (200)"} notes={"200 = 200 steps"} />
<SdoCard name={"Operation mode"} index={"0x8012"} subindex={"0x1"} value={"3"} notes={"3=position controller - this must be set"} />
<SdoCard name={"Speed range"} index={"0x8012"} subindex={"0x5"} value={"1"} notes={" 0=1000 steps/sec, 1=2000 steps/sec, 2=4000 steps/sec, 3=8000 steps/sec, 4=16000 steps/sec, 5=32000 steps/sec"} />
<SdoCard name={"invert motor polarity"} index={"x8012"} subindex={"0x9"} value={"0"} notes={"0 or 1"} />

## PDO mapping

We want to control the motor using the cyclic setting of positions. Beckhoff refer to this as "STM Control".

Two fixed PDOs are available for STM Control, 0x1602 & 0x1603 on SM2 and 0x1a03 & 0x1a07 on SM3.

**SM2**
* 0x1602 - contains bits for Enable, reset and reduce torque
* 0x1603 - contains a uint32 for set position


**SM3**
* 0x1a03 - contains bits for the status of the drive (error, warning, digitals inputs)
* 0x1a07 - contains a unit32 for actual position


So our PDO mapping objects in GBEM are:

```c
uint16_t map_SM2_index_of_assigned_PDO_el7031[ECM_MAX_PDO_MAPPING_ENTRIES] = {
        0x1602,
        0x1603};

uint16_t map_SM3_index_of_assigned_PDO_el7031[ECM_MAX_PDO_MAPPING_ENTRIES] = {
        0x1a03,
        0x1a07};
```

These are applied with the code seen in the function `gberror_t ec_pdo_map_el7031(const uint16_t slave)` in `EL7031.c` which simply loops over the arrays writing SDOs for each of the entries in the arrays you created.

## Default netscan

This is the output of the netscan with the default PDO mapping. You can see that the drive is not configured in position control mode so PDO mapping is definitely required for our purposes.

This looks much better, we have registers for setting position (Target position) and reading the position from the drives internal counter (Internal position).

Digital Input 1 and 2 are available in SM3, we can use these for a simple homing scheme if required.

The `Reduce Torque` bit in SM2 , allows us to set a bit to enter reduced current mode (when the drive is stationary). This is useful to, reduce overall power consumption and motor temperatures.

We can see from this there are set of bits that signal the status of the drive:
* Ready
* Warning
* Error
* Moving positive
* Moving negative
* Torque reduced

And a set of bits that trigger state changes of the drives:
* Enable
* Reset
* Reduce torque

So we will need to write the code that monitors the status bits and triggers the right state changes. For example:

"If NOT warning & error then set Enable"

## Writing the driver code

So, we have seen that this simple stepper drive does not support the CiA402 drive profile it just contains bits to enable & reset the drive and a set of bits that signal if the drive is ready to enable, enabled or has and error and warning.

GBEM expects drives to follow the CiA 402 state machine and provide an interface that mirrors this standard.

This means we have to write code in our driver software to emulate the CiA 402 statemachine in our driver code. This is not very complicated.

We have to maintain the CiA state of the drive in our driver code and map the very simple states of the El7031 onto the CiA 402 states.

You can see how we do it in the `EL7031.c` file.

# Older firmware versions

<Alert message="Caution" description="Older versions of the EL7031 firmware do not appear to support dynamic changes to position. We tested with an EL7031 with Firmware 13." type="warning" showIcon style={{margin: '20px 0 20px 0'}} />


# Testing

Here you can see us jogging the EL7031 from the glowbuzzer's toolkit web front-end.
