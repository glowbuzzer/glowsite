## Introduction

This short guide reviews the Nanotec N5 range of drives and discusses how to get them working with GBEM.

The manufacturer documentation for the drive is available <a href="https://en.nanotec.com/products/1597-1597-n5-motor-controller-a-vdc"> here</a>.

The drive is designed for both BLDC motors and stepper motors.

Nanotec are known for their high-quality range of motors and so there are many options available to pair with this drive.

They are available in a low-current version with 12-72 V operating voltage and 10 A rated current/10 A peak current as well as in a high-current version with 12-48 V operating voltage and 18 rated current/40 A peak current.

They have an encoder interface and hall sensor interface and work in a closed loop.

They have a brake output to control brakes for gravity hold applications.

## BoM for our testing

* Encoder - noe2-050k14
* Motor - st41442l-0804-b and st4118-k2v1825 - NEMA 17


## Wiring

The connectors on the N5 are as follows:

* X1 - Ethernet
* X2 - Encoder and Hall sensor connection
* X3 - Digital/analog inputs and outputs
* X4 - Brake connection
* X5 - Motor connection
* X6 - Voltage supply
* X7 - EtherCAT IN
* X8 - EtherCAT OUT
* X9 - External logic supply, input voltage +24 V DC Voltage supply for encoder, input voltage +24 V DC

X6,  For the version N5-1 (low current) that we are using takes 12 V - 72 V ±5% DC.

The pinout for X6 is as follows:
* 1 -  shield
* 2 - +ve
* 3 - gnd

A 24V 5A power supply was used for our testing.

To connect the nanotec plug-and-drive studio you use connector X1, either with Ethernet DHCP or your need to set your PC's IP address to 192.168.2.1.


## Drive commissioning software

Plug-n-drive studio is Nanotec's drive commissioning software. It is rather good.

It is free and can be downloaded from their website and installed.

Next connect to the drive:

import nanotec_pandd_connect from "./nanotec_pandd_connect.png?glowsite"

<Image meta={nanotec_pandd_connect} alt="Nanotec plug-and-drive connect"  maxWidth={800} />

The nanotec drives have a natty webinterface called NanoIP. Juts point a browser at the drive and hey-presto you can configure and test the drive!

N.B. 0x60C2 Interpolation Time Period can be 4ms - sync time always 1ms - this is important

## Error codes
The register `0x603f` provides a `uint16` error code.

Register `0x1003` provides an error code stack with 8 errors using an `uint32`. In `0x1003` the upper 8 bits are the error number


## Startup SDOs

The following SDOs are needed to be applied at startup to configure the drive:

<SdoCard name={"Min position limit"} index={"0x607d"} subindex={"0x1"} value={"Taken from machine config file"} notes={""} />
<SdoCard name={"Max position limit"} index={"0x607d"} subindex={"0x2"} value={"Taken from machine config file"} notes={""} />
<SdoCard name={"Polarity (direction of rotation)"} index={"0x607e"} subindex={"0x0"} value={"Taken from machine config file"} notes={""} />
<SdoCard name={"Quick stop option code"} index={"0x605a"} subindex={"0x0"} value={"1"} notes={"0 = immediate stop, 1 = braking with slow down ramp then change to switch on disabled (default), 2 = braking with quick stop ramp then change to switch on disabled"} />
<SdoCard name={"Motor revolutions (numerator for gear ratio)"} index={"0x6091"} subindex={"0x1"} value={"0x1"} notes={""} />
<SdoCard name={"Shaft revolutions (denominator for gear ratio)"} index={"0x6091"} subindex={"0x2"} value={""} notes={"1"} />
<SdoCard name={"Feed constant"} index={"0x6092"} subindex={"0x1"} value={"1"} notes={""} />
<SdoCard name={"Feed shaft revolutions"} index={"0x6092"} subindex={"0x2"} value={"1"} notes={""} />
<SdoCard name={"Interpolation time period"} index={"0x60c2"} subindex={"0x1"} value={"CYLCE_TIME"} notes={""} />

## PDO mapping

Looking at the drive's documentation we can see:

0x1600:
* Controlword
* TargetPosition
* Motordrivesubmodeselect
* Modes of operation

0x1601:
* TargetPosition
* Profilevelocity

0x1602:
* vi target velocity

0x1a00:
* Statusword
* Position actual value
* Modes of operation display

0x1a01:
* Position actual value
* vi velocity actual value

0x1a03:
* Digital inputs
* Read analogue input
* Read analogue input

The default PDO mapping is just 0x1600 and 0x1a00.

If you don't want to use the digital and analogue inputs then the default PDO will be fine for our purposes as we have access to:
* position (target and actual)
* controlword and statusword
* modes of operation

Which is sufficient to write our drive interface.

## Default netscan (and as we are not doing any PDO mapping the actual PDO map used)

In this scan the EEPROM does not contain friendly strings for the register names.

## Writing the driver code

The Nanotec drive follows the CiA 402 specification closely.

Writing the drive software is straight forward.

You can see how we do it in the `n5.c` file.
