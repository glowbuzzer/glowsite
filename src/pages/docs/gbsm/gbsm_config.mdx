    - `gbsm_config.h` is the main config. file
    - some config. parameters set with cmake -`gbsm_defs_pi.cmake`
    - These parameters will need to be adapted to your environment
</Tldr>

`gbsm_config` is a static library in which is the `gbsm_config.h` file.

This is where the primary compile time configuration parameters for GBSM are set.

The file is well commented.

The type of configuration parameters that can be set in the file include:

`BUS_CYCLE_TIME` - the cyclic period that GBSM executes at
`DISABLE_ESTOP_CHECKING` - estop checking is disabled
`GBSM_ENABLE_VSTOPS` - enables the soft limit checking on the driver ICs

Some parameters are set with cmake - see `gbsm_defs_pi.cmake`. These include things like the logging level.
