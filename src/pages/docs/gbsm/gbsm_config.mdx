    - The main config. file is `gbsm_config.h`
    - Some config. parameters set with cmake -`gbsm_defs_pi.cmake`
    - These parameters will need to be adapted to your environment
</Tldr>

`gbsm_config` is a static library in which is the `gbsm_config.h` file.

This is where the primary compile time configuration parameters for &gbsm are set.

The file is well commented.

The type of configuration parameters that can be set in the file include:

`BUS_CYCLE_TIME` - the cyclic period that &gbsm executes at
`DISABLE_ESTOP_CHECKING` - estop checking is disabled
`GBSM_ENABLE_VSTOPS` - enables the soft limit checking on the driver ICs

Some parameters are set with cmake - see `gbsm_defs_pi.cmake`. These include things like the logging level.
