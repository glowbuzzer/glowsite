&gbsm takes a single optional command line argument `-p` which denotes the program within &gbsm to run.

Usually you just run &gbsm without the `-pCYCLIC` option as this is the default.

`-pCYCLIC` makes &gbsm run in the normal cyclic mode where it communicates with &gbc.

The optional programs are used to test and configured the motor drivers.

Available programs:

* `-pREG_READ` to read a register
* `-pTEST_MOVE` to execute a test oscillating move on all connected motors
* `-pHYST_TUNE` to execute hysteresis tuning on the motors
