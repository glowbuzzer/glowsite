GBSM takes a single optional command line argument `-p` which denotes the program within GBSM to run.

Usually you just run GBSM without the `-pCYCLIC` option as this is the default.

`-pCYCLIC` makes GBSM run in the normal cyclic mode where it communicates with GBC.

The optional programs are used to test and configured the motor drivers.

Available programs:

* `-pREG_READ` to read a register
* `-pTEST_MOVE` to execute a test oscillating move on all connected motors
* `-pHYST_TUNE` to execute hysteresis tuning on the motors
