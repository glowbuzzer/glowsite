## Running GBSM

GBSM takes a single optional command line argument `-p` which denotes the program within GBSM to run.

Usually GBSM is run without the `-p` option or with `-pCYCLIC` which makes GBSM run in the normal cyclic mode where it communicates with GBC.

The optional programs are to used to test and configured the motor drivers.

Available programs:

* `-pREG_READ` to read a register
* `-pTEST_MOVE` to execute a test oscillating move on all connected motors
* `-pHYST_TUNE` to execute hysteresis tuning on the motors
