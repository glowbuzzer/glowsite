## What does GBSM do?

GBSM is the part of the glowbuzzer toolkit used for communicating with motor driver ICs over SPI from Linux or microcontroller platforms.

On Linux, GBSM talks to GBC over shared memory and, at bus cycle speed (1ms, 2ms , 4ms etc.), it receives commands to control motors and IO from GBC.

On microcontroller platforms GBSM uses SPI to talk to GBC.

GBSM translates these high-level commands from GBC into those needed by the motor drivers and sends them out over SPI to the individual driver ICs.

It also receives position and status information over SPI from the motor drivers and passes this back over shared memory to GBC.

## What motor driver chips does GBSM work with?

We mainly work with the [Trinamic](www.trinamic.com) motor driver ICs.

The reference hardware platform for GBSM consists of the Trinamic TMC4361A and TMC1560/TMC5130 but other combinations of Trinamic chips (e.g. TMC4361A+TMC2130) can be supported.

## What platforms does GBSM run on?

The reference version of GBSM is based of the Raspberry Pi. This uses the pigpio SPI and gpio driver software.

We also have versions available that use the Linux Kernel SPI and GPIO drivers and can be used on embedded Linux platforms.

There is also a port to STM32 for embedded microcontroller applications.

On Linux GBSM requires a real-time patched kernel (preemmpt).

Development can be performed on WSL/virtual machines but deployment must be to a real time platforms

## Main features

* A CiA 402 based state machine framework to control machines and motor drives
* A simple shared memory interface over which drives and IO can be controlled from your web stack high-level control application
* Real-time execution - the lowest achievable cycle times depends on hardware. Typically, 0.5ms, 1ms or 4ms cycles are used
* A code based suitable for use on both Linux and microcontroller targets
* Open Source code base
