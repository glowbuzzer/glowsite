## Introduction
<Tldr>
    - Just digital IO is implemented in the reference code base
    - Easy to extend to analog IO
    - Simple mapping between Linux GPIO and &gbc IO is provided
</Tldr>
The &gbc and the front-end React components in the &gbt provide support for:

* Digital IO
* Analog IO
* Integer IO

The reference codebase for &gbsm is written for the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi does not have any DACs/ADCs on the board only GPIO.

Hence, the only types of IO supported by the codebase are digital IOs.

For a real production use of &gbsm, if analog inputs and outputs are required, custom electronics will be developed that delivers the isolated analog IO required.

This could take the form of 4-20mA communication systems or 0-10V IO or whatever your design needs.

This would likely take the form (for input) of an isolated, single or multi-channel ADC that provides an SPI interface that would be integrated with the embedded Linux or microcontroller running GBCSM.

## The digital IO implementation in the &gbsm reference code

The code pages the Pi's GPIO pins onto the &gbc digital inputs and outputs.

The mapping is configured using the following array (in `io.c`):
```c
io_map_t io_map[NUM_PI_GPIO] = {
[1] = {GPIO_NOT_USED, 0},
[26] = {GPIO_OUT, 3}
};
```

The array's index is the PI's GPIO number and the second element of the array is the &gbc IO number.

They can be defined as inputs or outputs using the enum:

`typedef enum {GPIO_NOT_USED, GPIO_IN, GPIO_OUT} gpio_function_t;`

* GPIO_NOT_USED - not used
* GPIO_IN - GPIO is used as an input
* GPIO_OUT - GPIO is used as an ouput


Two functions are provided to read and write the GPIOs.

`void io_set_dout(uint8_t gbc_dout_num, bool value, gberror_t *rc)`
This sets the Pi GPIO pin corresponding to the &gbc IO number.

`bool io_get_din(uint8_t gbc_din_num, gberror_t *rc)`
This reads a Pi GPIO pin corresponding to the &gbc IO number.

On different embedded Linux environments to the Pi, these can be easily adapted to how they control their GPIO pins.
