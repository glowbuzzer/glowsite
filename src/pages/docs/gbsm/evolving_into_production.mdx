The prototype of the TMC4351A and TMC5160 is a fair way away from a production design for a machine control. This section provides a high-level discussion of how the prototype would need to evolve to cope with the demands of a production machine control.

## IO

Limit switches

GPIO

isolated 24V io

* paralled
* SPI

Need 24V capable io isolates

## Encoders

Need to decide if encoders are going to be used with the stepper motors.

The choice is

* ABN incremental encoders
* Absolute multi-turn encoder (SPi or SSI)



## PSU

Need 3.3v PSU plus the motor power supply.



* encoders
* PSU



## Safety
