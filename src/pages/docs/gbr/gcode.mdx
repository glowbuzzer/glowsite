The &gcode hook allows you to execute a &gcode program. The &gcode commands will be translated into activities and
streamed to &gbc. Instructions G64 and G61 can be used to control blending. The following example shows a simple
use of the hook to draw a square.

```jsx
const gcode=useGCode()
gcode.send(`
    G64 ; enable blending
    G0 X100 Y0
    G1 X100 Y100
    G1 X0 Y100
    G1 X0 Y0
`)
```

The &gcode hook also provides the state of the current stream, the line number currently executing and a method to stop, pause
and resume. For more information, see <TypedocLink name={"useGCode"}/>.

The &gbt supports most of the standard G-Codes with a handful of variations, omissions and extensions that are described here.

There should be no issues exporting &gcode from standard CAM tools if care is taken with the post-processor.
