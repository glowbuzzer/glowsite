React hooks let you use state and other React features without writing class components and with the minimum of boilerplate code.
For general information about hooks see the [React hooks documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

GBR provides an extensive set of hooks that give easy access to the GBR Redux store and allow you to interact with a remote GBC instance.
The GBR hooks underpin all of our [tiles](../tiles/overview) and [controls](../controls/overview).
