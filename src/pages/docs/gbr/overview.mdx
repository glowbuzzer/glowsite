    - Redux store
    - Reusable UI controls
    - Hooks
    - Simple state machine
</Tldr>

The &gbr part of the toolkit provides a framework and set of controls that help you get up and running quickly building machine controls using web technology.

This framework is built on other open source projects, primarily React, Redux and Ant Design.

## Documentation structure

This area of the documentation contains:

* Instructions for creating a new project using the glowbuzzer Create React App template
* Instructions for cloning and running one of the sample projects
* GBR controls reference. The controls provide re-usable components you can use in your own &ui projects
* GBR tiles reference. Tiles are a way of composing a full drag and drop &ui
* GBR hooks reference. Hooks allow you to communicate with &gbc over websockets and provide access to the GBR Redux store
* GBR Redux details. Provides information about how to use the Redux store directly and how to extend it with your own state
* GBR state machine. Describes how to use the GBR simple state machine to coordinate activities
* GBR skeleton application. Show how to create a minimal GBR application
* GBR imports. Describes ways to minimise external dependencies according to the features you need

You might also like to view the [basic getting started tutorial](/get-started/frontend) which shows how to toggle a digital output and move a drive.

If you are integrating with &gbc at the websocket level and not using React, you will need the [GBC schema reference](/docs/gbc/schema).
