&gbr provides a framework and set of components that help you get up and running quickly building machine controls using web technology.
It's built on other open source projects, primarily React, Redux and Ant Design.

&gbr consists of two distinct NPM packages:

@glowbuzzer/store

: Provides the Redux store at the heart of &gbr and hooks to make it easy to interact with the store

@glowbuzzer/controls

: Built on top of the store, provides visual components that you can use to build out your &fe

Full source code for both of these modules is [<GithubOutlined/> available on Github](https://www.github.com/glowbuzzer).

## New project template and examples

The simplest way to create a new &fe project is to use the &gb CRA starter template ([full instructions](/get-started/frontend)).

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template glowbuzzer-typescript --use-npm
```

You might also want to start with one of our complete example projects. If you haven't encountered these before we recommend you [follow the quick start page](/get-started/simulation).

Generic example ([<GithubOutlined/> Github](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/tree/main/examples/generic))

: A demo of a cartesian machine control with auxillary axis.

Robot example ([<GithubOutlined/> Github](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/tree/main/examples/staubli))

: A demo of a 6-DOF robot machine control.

## Documentation structure

This area of the documentation contains:

* Instructions for creating a new project using the glowbuzzer Create React App template
* Instructions for cloning and running one of the sample projects
* GBR controls reference. The controls provide re-usable components you can use in your own &ui projects
* GBR tiles reference. Tiles are a way of composing a full drag and drop &ui
* GBR hooks reference. Hooks allow you to communicate with &gbc over websockets and provide access to the GBR Redux store
* GBR Redux details. Provides information about how to use the Redux store directly and how to extend it with your own state
* GBR state machine. Describes how to use the GBR simple state machine to coordinate activities
* GBR skeleton application. Show how to create a minimal GBR application
* GBR imports. Describes ways to minimise external dependencies according to the features you need

You might also like to view the [basic getting started tutorial](/get-started/frontend) which shows how to toggle a digital output and move a drive.

If you are integrating with &gbc at the websocket level and not using React, you will need the [GBC schema reference](/docs/gbc/schema).
