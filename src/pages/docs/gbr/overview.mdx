&gbr provides a framework and set of components that help you get up and running quickly building machine controls using web technology.
It's built on other open source projects, primarily React, Redux and Ant Design.

&gbr consists of two distinct NPM packages:

Store (`@glowbuzzer/store`)

: Provides the Redux store at the heart of &gbr and a set of React hooks to make it easy to interact with the store.

Controls (`@glowbuzzer/controls`)

: Built on top of the store, this package provides React components that you can use to build out your &fe. Within this package you will find
[low-level controls](controls/overview) and [tiles](tiles/overview) which provide a consistent look and feel for your application.

Full source code for both of these modules is [<GithubOutlined/> available on Github](https://www.github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr).

## Getting started

The simplest way to create a new &fe project is to use the &gb CRA starter template. For detailed instructions, see [Creating a React &fe](/get-started/frontend) under _Getting Started_.

You might also want to start with one of our more complete example projects. If you haven't seen these running before we recommend you [follow the quick start page](/get-started/simulation)
which lets you use our hosted versions of the apps and connect to &gbc running in simulation mode.

Generic example ([<GithubOutlined/> Github](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/tree/main/examples/generic))

: A demo of a cartesian machine control with auxillary axis.

Robot example ([<GithubOutlined/> Github](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/tree/main/examples/staubli))

: A demo of a 6-DOF robot machine control.

If you want to create a &gbr application with minimal dependencies, see [Managing dependencies](minimal). This explains how to
control what is imported from the `@glowbuzzer/controls` package.
