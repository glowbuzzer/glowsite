This page describes how to create a GBR application with the smallest possible bundle size.

&gbr includes a number of components with dependencies on large, mainstream open source projects, for example:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a wrapper for WebGL (3d animation)
- [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), a React wrapper for Three.js
- [D3](https://d3js.org), a library for creating 2d animations using SVG
- [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io), a code editor
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design), a React component library
- [styled components](https://styled-components.com), a React CSS-in-JS library

It is quite likely you don't need all these libraries in your project, in which case you may want to use
more specific imports from `@glowbuzzer/controls` to avoid your build automatically including these libraries and
thus increasing your bundle size.

As an example, let's suppose you are building a &fe that uses the &gcode tile (which allows users to edit and
run &gcode) but doesn't use any of the other &gbr tiles we provide. The &gcode tile uses the Ace Editor to provide syntax highlighting,
but for this application you do not need to include D3, among others.

## Importing using a more specific path

Normally to use the &gcode tile you would simply import from `@glowbuzzer/controls`, for example:

```jsx
import {GCodeTile} from "@glowbuzzer/controls"

const MyApp = () => <GCodeTile/>
```

Unless your chosen build tool is good at tree shaking, this approach will introduce a dependency on D3 and other libraries
you don't need.

To avoid this issue, import from more specific paths in the `@glowbuzzer/controls` package. For example, in this case:

```jsx
import {GCodeTile} from "@glowbuzzer/controls/gcode"

const MyApp = () => <GCodeTile/>
```

This will ensure that your build tool will only include the code you need.

## NPM and optional dependencies

The glowbuzzer packages use `optionalDependencies` in `package.json`, to give you more control over the install process.
By default these dependencies will be installed, thus making the initial setup as seemless as possible.

If you want to avoid installing a dependency you don't need into `node_modules`, you can use the
`--no-optional` flag when installing the package, for example:

```bash
npm install @glowbuzzer/controls --no-optional
```

If you want to make sure this is the case whenever you run `npm install`, you can add the following to your `.npmrc` file in
the root of your project:

```bash
omit=optional
```

## Paths available and their dependencies

The table below gives the paths available in `@glowbuzzer/controls` and the dependencies they require, plus the components
exported from each. You can use this table to understand the composition of the package and which paths you can use based on the
components you are using, plus the dependencies required.
