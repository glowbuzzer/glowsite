This page describes how to create a GBR application with the smallest possible bundle size.

&gbr includes a number of components with dependencies on large, mainstream open source projects, for example:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a wrapper for WebGL (3d animation)
- [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), a React wrapper for Three.js
- [D3](https://d3js.org), a library for creating 2d animations using SVG
- [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io), a code editor
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design), a React component library
- [styled components](https://styled-components.com), a React CSS-in-JS library

It is quite likely you don't need all these libraries in your project, in which case you may want to use
more specific imports from `@glowbuzzer/controls` to avoid your build automatically including these libraries and
thus increasing your bundle size.

As an example, let's suppose you are building a &fe that uses the &gcode tile which allows users to edit and
run &gcode but doesn't use any of the other &gbr tiles we provide. The &gcode tile uses the Ace Editor to provide syntax highlighting,
but for this application you do not need to include Three.js or D3, among others.

Normally to use the &gcode tile you would simply import from `@glowbuzzer/controls`, for example:

```jsx
import {GCodeTile} from "@glowbuzzer/controls"

const MyApp = () => <GCodeTile/>
```

Unless your chosen build tool is very good at tree shaking, this approach will introduce a dependency on Three.js and other libraries
you don't need. You will also need to include these in your `package.json` dependencies - not ideal.

To avoid this issue, import from more specific paths in the `@glowbuzzer/controls` package. For example, in this case:

```jsx
import {GCodeTile} from "@glowbuzzer/controls/gcode"

const MyApp = () => <GCodeTile/>
```
