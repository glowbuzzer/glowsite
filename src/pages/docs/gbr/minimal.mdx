This page describes how to create a GBR application with the smallest possible bundle size.

&gbr includes a number of components with dependencies on large, mainstream open source projects, for example:

- Three.js
- React Three Fiber (a wrapper for Three.js)
- D3
- Ace Editor
- TODO MORE

It is quite likely you don't need all these libraries in your project, in which case you will want to use
more specific imports in `@glowbuzzer/controls` to avoid your bundler automatically including these libraries and
thus increasing your bundle size.
