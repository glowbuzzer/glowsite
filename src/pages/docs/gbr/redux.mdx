    - Create the GBR Redux store from scratch
    - Add your own custom state to the store
    - See the list of standard GBR slices
</Tldr>

&gbr uses Redux extensively under the covers. This page describes the structure of the store, how to instantiate it and how to add your own state.

The GBR Redux store is created using the official [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) and separated into multiple "slices". Each slice is responsible for a different part of the store.

## Instantiating and customising the store

If you simply want to add a custom reducer to the &gbr store and you are using the `GlowbuzzerApp` component, it provides an `additionalReducers` property you can use to merge
your reducer into the standard &gbr reducers. The example below assumes your are using Redux Toolkit slices but this is not required.

```tsx
<GlowbuzzerApp additionalReducers={{mySlice: mySlice.reducer}}></GlowbuzzerApp>
```

The more complex example below shows full customisation of the &gbr store. This example is based on code in the existing
[GlowbuzzerApp](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr/blob/main/libs/controls/src/GlowbuzzerApp.tsx) component. Normally this level of
detail is not required.

```tsx demo
import React from "react"
import { standardReducers } from "@glowbuzzer/store"
import { Provider, useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux"
import { combineReducers, configureStore, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import { Button } from "antd";

const acmeSlice = createSlice({
    name: "acme",
    initialState: "Default value from store - click to change",
    reducers: {
        set: (store, action) => {
            // simply store the given value
            return action.payload
        }
    }
})

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    ...standardReducers,
    acme: acmeSlice.reducer
})

type StoreType = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>

const TestComponent = () => {
    const value = useSelector(({ acme }: StoreType) => acme)
    const dispatch = useDispatch()

    function update() {
        dispatch(acmeSlice.actions.set("New value!"))
    }

    return <>
        <div>{value}</div>
        <Button onClick={update}>Change</Button>
    </>
}

export default /* app component */ () => {
    const middleware = getDefault => {
        // these dev-only checks really hurt performance, so turn them off!
        return getDefault({ immutableCheck: false, serializableCheck: false })
    }

    const store = configureStore({
        reducer: rootReducer,
        middleware
    })

    return (
        <Provider store={store}>
            <TestComponent/>
        </Provider>
    )
}
```
