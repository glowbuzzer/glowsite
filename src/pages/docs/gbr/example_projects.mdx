The GBR source code includes a number of example projects which you can run if you aren't ready to create a new project as described in
[Creating a starter project](starter_project).

TODO: Restructure gbr examples as below and add npm "start" script

The simplest way to run one of the starter projects is as follows:

1. Clone the GBR project repository from Github and install dependencies

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbr.git
    cd gbr
    # you can use npm, yarn or pnpm
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the example, in this case `generic`

    ```shell
    npm run start:generic
    ```

The source code can be found in `gbr/examples`.
