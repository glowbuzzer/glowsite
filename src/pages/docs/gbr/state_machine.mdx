# Glowbuzzer React (GBR) Simple State Machine

It is often useful to run a sequence of activities on a machine, and this can rapidly lead to quite complex interactions.

It's possible to maintain state in React and drive transitions as this state changes, but this can become quite
tedious and error-prone without some kind of framework.

GBR provides a hook [useStateMachine](/docs/gbr/hooks/useStateMachine) and the structure
for a simple state machine definition that can help in these scenarios.

Below is a worked example. This example is self-contained and does not interact with a machine; you can extend this example
using [useSoloActivity](/docs/gbr/hooks/useSoloActivity) in order to execute real activities.

The example consists of three states: `idle`, `forward` and `back`. The idle state is entered whenever `run` is not set.
When `run` is set (via the button click handler), the state machine alternates between the `forward` and `back` states
every two seconds.

The example demonstrates how the `enter` callback on a state can run asynchronous tasks and trigger transitions when a promise is resolved.
This could be at the end of a move, for example.

```jsx demo
import {useStateMachine} from "@glowbuzzer/store"
import {useState} from "react"
import {Button} from "antd"

// helper to create promise resolved after a delay
const delay=(next, ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(next), ms))

export default () => {
    const [run, setRun]=useState(false)
    const [forwardCompletedCount, setForwardCompletedCount]=useState(0)

    const {currentState, previousState, userData}=useStateMachine({
        idle: {
            transitions: {
                forward: run
            }
        },
        forward: {
            enter() {
                console.log("enter forward")
                return delay({
                    state: "back",
                    data: "going back now"
                }, 2000)
            },
            exit() {
                setForwardCompletedCount(count => count+1)
            },
            transitions: {
                idle: !run
            }
        },
        back: {
            enter() {
                console.log("enter backward")
                return delay({
                    state: "forward",
                    data: "going forward now"
                }, 2000)
            },
            transitions: {
                idle: !run
            }
        },
    }, "idle", [run])

    return <div>
        <h3>Simple state machine example</h3>
        <p>The current state is: {currentState} (from {previousState || "none"})</p>
        <p>The data from last transition is: {userData || "none"}</p>
        <p>Forward cycles completed: {forwardCompletedCount}</p>

        <p><Button onClick={()=> setRun(run => !run)}>{run ? "Stop" : "Start"}</Button></p>
    </div>
}
```
