The streaming activity API allows you to execute a sequence of activities and wait for them to complete (using promises).
There are two main advantages of using the streaming API over the solo activity API:

Precise and real-time transitions between activities

: When one activity finishes the next is started in the following cycle without any delay. Using triggers based on
tick count, it's also possible to precisely synchronize motion between multiple independent kinematics configurations.

Blending moves

: When streaming, moves can be blended to avoid exact stop at the end of each move. This leads to faster completion of
tasks.

When streaming, you are able to react to the completion of each individual activity, or the stream as a whole.

The API is non-blocking when adding activities to the stream. The activities are buffered in the &fe and sent
to &gbc as capacity on the &gbc queue becomes available.

The example below shows a simple sequence of streamed moves, with handling of completion during and after the
sequence completes.

```jsx
const stream=useStream(0)
await stream.send(api => [
    api.moveLine(0, 10).promise(),
    api.moveArc(2,12).centre(2,10).direction(ARCDIRECTION.ARCDIRECTION_CW).promise(),
    api.moveLine(10, 12).promise(),
    api.moveArc(12,10).centre(10,10).direction(ARCDIRECTION.ARCDIRECTION_CW)
        .promise().then(() => console.log("second arc complete")),
    api.moveLine(12, 0).promise(),
    api.moveArc(10,-2).centre(10,0).direction(ARCDIRECTION.ARCDIRECTION_CW).promise(),
    api.moveLine(2, -2).promise(),
    api.moveArc(0,0).centre(2,0).direction(ARCDIRECTION.ARCDIRECTION_CW).promise()
]).then(() => {
    console.log("sequence complete!")
})
```
