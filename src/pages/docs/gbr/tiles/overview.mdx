- Tiles provide building blocks for your application
- Wide variety of tiles provided
- Create your own tiles
</Tldr>

The &gbr tiles provide high-level building blocks for your front-end project. Tiles give your project a consistent, clean
look and feel and cover a wide range of use cases.

If you want to extend the &gbr tiles, full source code is available on Github. You can [create your own tiles](Tile) or
bypass the tiles look and feel altogether and create an entirely custom &fe. The tiles we provide leverage the hooks provided by the `@glowbuzzer/store` package and
generally consist of simple code you can easily copy and modify.
