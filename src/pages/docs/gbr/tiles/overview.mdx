- Tiles provide building blocks for your application
- Wide variety of tiles provided
- Create your own tiles
</Tldr>

The &gbr tiles provide high-level building blocks for your front-end project. Tiles give your project a consistent, clean
look and feel and cover a wide range of use cases. The tiles are intended to be used as part of a docking layout, as described
in the [&gbr docking layout](/docs/gbr/dock/overview) section, and as shown in the example projects.

If you need to modify or extend the &gbr tiles, full source code is available on Github. Tiles leverage the
hooks provided by the `@glowbuzzer/store` package and generally consist of simple code ready copy and modify.
