[Hooks in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) let you use state and other React features without writing class components and
with the minimum of boilerplate code.

This is useful in machine control applications where there is often a lot of state.

The hooks also provide convenient access to the GBR Redux store.
