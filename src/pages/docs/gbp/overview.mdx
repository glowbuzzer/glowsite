&gbpl provides a robust and flexible way to communicate with &gbcl from Python. It provides an API that allows you to
control the robot in a procedural or event-driven style. It also provides simple integration with ROS2.

The API is fully typed using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), providing a great developer experience.

The library is open source. See the [<GithubOutlined/> Github Repository](https://github.com/glowbuzzer/gbp) for more information.
