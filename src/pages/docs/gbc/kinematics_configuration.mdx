    - &gbc includes forward and inverse kinematics models for common machine structures
    - Forward kinematics = angle of joints -> position and orientation of tool
    - Inverse kinematics = position and orientation of tool -> angle of joints
    - Multiple solutions to inverse kinematics
    - Different solution sets = robot configurations
</Tldr>


# Robot configurations

Where a robot can have multiple sets of joint angles that result in the same tool centre point (TCP) cartesian position and orientation, the robot has multiple configurations.

For example, for a standard industrial robot arm, one of their configurations is known as lefty and righty.
