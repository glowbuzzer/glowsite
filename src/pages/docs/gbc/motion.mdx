## Introduction

GBC has a sophisticated motion control at its heart.

With GBC we can control:

* Single joint motion control - e.g. move a joint to a position, move a joint at velocity

* Multiple joints in master/slave - e.g. move joint 1 at twice the velocity of joint 2

* Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space - e.g. move a tool through 3D space along a line or arc

## Single joint motion control

This is the most basic form of motion control.



move to a position

move at velocity

move superimpose

stop


## Multiple joints in master slave



## Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space



Move Line

Move Arc









## Activities that perform motion



For moves planned in cartesian space with cartesian space targets:

* `MoveArc`

* `MoveLine`

Moves planned in joint space with cartesian space target:

* `MoveToPosition`

Moves planning in joint space with joint space target
* `MoveJoints`
* `MoveJointsAtVelocity`
