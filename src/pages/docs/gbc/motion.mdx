## Introduction

&gbc has a sophisticated motion control at its heart.

With &gbc we can control:

* Single joint motion control - for example, move a joint to a position, move a joint at velocity

* Multiple joints in master/slave - for example, move joint 1 at twice the velocity of joint 2

* Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space - for example, move a tool through 3D space along a line or arc

## Single joint motion control

This is the most basic form of motion control. It allows you control a joint in the following ways:

* Move to a position specified either relative to current position or absolutely
* Move at velocity when the joint ramps up speed to a given velocity
* Move superimpose where a relative movement is superimposed on top of a current move

## Multiple joints in master slave

Joints can be slaved together. This is a master/slave arrangement where

## Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space

Moving in 3D cartesian

* Move Line
* Move Arc

## Activities that perform motion

For moves planned in cartesian space with cartesian space targets:

* `MoveArc`

* `MoveLine`

Moves planned in joint space with cartesian space target:

* `MoveToPosition`

Moves planning in joint space with joint space target
* `MoveJoints`
* `MoveJointsAtVelocity`
