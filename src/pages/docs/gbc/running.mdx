<Tldr>
    - Usually just `./GBC` is enough to run &gbc
    - Command line options are used to vary defaults
    - &gbc must run on a preempted kernel for real-time performance
    - Real-time kernel is not needed for sim mode or development
</Tldr>
## Running
<RunGbc/>


## Key things to look out for in the console output.

### emstat paths

The paths &gbc is using to store the emstat files are detailed.

```text
[INFO  ] GBC: The path we are using for emstat const file [/tmp/emstat_const.json]
[INFO  ] GBC: The path we are using for emstat const file [/tmp/emstat_status.json]
[INFO  ] GBC: The path we are using for config file [/tmp/config.json]
```

### config. JSON file loading details are confirmed.

&gbc loads its JSON config. files from the file system and these JSON files must be placed in the directory alongside the &gbc executable.

The config.json file is the first one loaded and it may `include` further JSON files.

If the file is found you will see:

```text
[INFO  ] GBC-JS: loading file [configs/my_machine_config.json]
```


### Bus cycle time

Of course, the bus cycle time is pretty important and this affects lots of things like the scaling of trajectories so it needs to match that used on the fieldbus.

You can see its value that has been read from the config. json files here:

```text
[INFO  ] GBC-M7: Machine bus cycle time is [4] ms
```


### Further confirmation of config. settings

Further confirmation of the config. settings is output to console in sections like this:

```text
