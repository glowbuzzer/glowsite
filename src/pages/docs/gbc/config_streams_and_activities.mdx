## Introduction

Streams refer to the process used to stream commands from &gbr to &gbc.

soloActivity is the API used to invoke activities on &gbc individually from &gbr.

## Tips for defining Stream and SoloActivity configs

The stream section of the config is brief and just defines one or more stream. Each config requires at least one stream.

The soloActivity section of the config maps solo activities to kcs. This simply "connects" a kc to a solo activity so that when using the solo activity API you can control different kcs with different solo activities.

stream 0 = kc0

soloactivty 0 = kc 0

## Example JSON

In this example there is just a single stream named `"default"`.

```json
 "stream": {
        "default": {
        }
    },
```

In this config soloActivity index 0 maps to the `"default"` kc and soloActivity index 1 maps to the `"aux"` kc.

```json
"soloActivity": {
        "default": {
        },
        "aux": {
        }
    },
```
