# IO in GBC

<Tldr>
     - GBC supports:
        - digital inputs and outputs
        - analog inputs and outputs (floats)
        - integer inputs and outputs
</Tldr>

Machines contain different types of IO.

* **Digital Inputs** - e.g. a position sensing switch, float sensor
* **Digital Outputs** - e.g. a pump, indicator lamp, pneumatic valve
* **Analog Inputs** - e.g. signals from pressure transducers and temperature from thermocouples
* **Analog Outputs** - e.g. a speed control signal for a Variable Frequency Drive

IO can be manipulated in a number of different ways:

* gcode using m codes
* in a react component itself
* in an activity - setDout
