## Introduction

The machine section of the config is brief and just sets:

* The speed of status updates between &gbc and &gbr
* The bus cycle time which is the speed at which the fieldbus (or other communications bus) is updated)

## Tips for defining Machine configs

You can currently only define a single machine in your configuration.

The name of the machine is not used though is accessible in the &gbr API if you need it.

`busCycleTime` needs to be 1, 2, 4 and must match the bus cycle time in &gbem or &gbsm and is needed to ensure the calculated trajectories match the actual cycle at which they are sent to motors. This is measured in milliseconds.

`statusFrequency` is the frequency of status updates (between 20 and 1000, in milliseconds) between &gbr and &gbr. This defines how many updates the front-end receives from GBC over the websockets connection each second. Depending on exactly what your front-end applications does, you will need to tune this parameter so that front-end updates speedily but without stressing either &gbr or the browser.

    `machine` in the config file maps to `MachineConfig` in the schema

## Example JSON

This creates a machine called default, with a bus cycle time of 4ms and a status update period of 20ms.

```json
"machine": [
  {
    "name": "default",
    "busCycleTime": 4,
    "statusFrequency": 20
  }
]

```
