## Introduction

The machine section of the config is brief and just sets the speed of status updates and the bus cycle time - the speed at which the fieldbus (or other communications bus) is updated)

## Details

`busCycleTime` needs to be 1, 2, 4 and must match the bus cycle time in &gbem or &gbsm and is needed to ensure the calculated trajectories match the actual cycle at which they are sent to motors. This is measured in milliseconds.

`statusFrequency` is the frequency of status updates (between 20 and 1000, in milliseconds) between &gbr and &gbr. This defines how many updates the front-end receives from GBC over the websockets connection each second.


## Example JSON

```json
"machine": {
    "default": {
    "busCycleTime": 4
    "statusFrequency": 20
    }
}
```

`machine` maps to `MachineConfig` - see <Link to="/docs/gbc/schema/MachineConfig">here for the schema documentation</Link>
