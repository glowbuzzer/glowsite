## Introduction

The spindle section of the config is where spindle control is configured.

This implementation of spindle control covers only very simple spindles e.g. a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) where digital outputs turn the spindle on/off and set its direction and an analogue output controls the spindle's speed.

&gbr is easily customised to support more complex spindles.

## Details

`"directionDigitalOutIndex"` - Index of the digital output used to control direction of spindle

`"directionInvert"` - Defines if the spindle direction is inverted (0 or 1)

`"enableDigitalOutIndex"` - Index of the digital output used to turn on the spindle

`"speedAnalogOutIndex"` - Index of the analogue output used to control the spindle speed

## Example JSON

Here we define a spindle (index 0, key="spindle") which uses Digital Out #0 to turn it on/off and Digital out #1 to control its direction (CW/CCW). Its direction is not inverted. It uses Analogue Output #0 to set its speed.

```json
 "spindle": {
    "0": {
      "enableDigitalOutIndex": 0,
      "directionDigitalOutIndex": 1,
      "directionInvert": false,
      "speedAnalogOutIndex": 0
    }
  },
```
