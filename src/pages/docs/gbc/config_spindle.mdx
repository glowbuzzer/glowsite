## Introduction

The spindle section of the config is where spindle control is configured. A spindle in this sense is a rotating joint that is not controlled as part of co-ordinated motion.

A spindle has the following states:
* its rotation is either on or off
* it is rotating in either a CW or CCW direction
* it is rotating at a given speed

This implementation of spindle control covers only very simple spindles for example, a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) where digital outputs turn the spindle on/off and set its direction and an analogue output controls the spindle's speed.

&gbr is easily customised to support more complex spindles.

## Tips for defining spindle configs

Three Digital Outs and one analogue output are needed to use the simple spindle control.

    `spindle` in the config file maps to `SpindleConfig` in the schema

## Example JSON

Here we define a spindle (index 0, key="spindle") which uses Digital Out #0 to turn it on/off and Digital out #1 to control its direction (CW/CCW). Its direction is not inverted. It uses Analogue Output #0 to set its speed.

```json
 "spindle": [
    {
      "name": "Default",
      "enableDigitalOutIndex": 0,
      "directionDigitalOutIndex": 1,
      "directionInvert": false,
      "speedAnalogOutIndex": 0
    }
  ]
```
