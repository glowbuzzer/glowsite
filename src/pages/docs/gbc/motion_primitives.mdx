## Introduction

&gbc has a sophisticated motion control at its heart. This allows you to control the motion of joints directly and to control the motion of one or more kinematics configurations in 3D space (coordinated moves).

* Single joint motion control - for example, move a joint to a position, move a joint at velocity
* Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space - for example, move a tool through 3D space along a line or arc

&gbc provides a number of motion primitives to enable different kinds of motion. These can be invoked in different ways depending on your use case.

## Interacting with the &gbc motion primitives

Motion primitives can be invoked in different ways. Ultimately they are all sent to &gbc as JSON over the &ws interface, but there are a number of ways to do this.

### Using our existing React front-end visual components (tiles)

You can add pre-built tiles such as [CartesianJogTile](/docs/gbr/tiles/CartesianJogTile),
[JointJogTile](/docs/gbr/tiles/JointJogTile) and [GCodeTile](/docs/gbr/tiles/GCodeTile) to your React project which give you an "out of the box" way to invoke motion primitives.

For further information, see the [Tiles](/docs/gbr/tiles/overview) reference documentation, or you might want to start with the [Getting Started](/get-started/frontend) guide.

Under the covers these tiles use the hooks described in the next sections to perform motion.

### Using the glowbuzzer hooks

Programmatically, the easiest route to invoke motion primitive from a React Application is to use the hooks provided by the glowbuzzer library. These are:

[useSoloActivity](/docs/gbr/hooks/useSoloActivity)

: The solo activity API is instantiated against a kinematics configuration and has exclusive access to the motion of that KC. You can start a solo activity, await its completion and then start another.

[useStream](/docs/gbr/hooks/useStream)

: The stream API allows you to stream activities to &gbc. These activities are queued and executed in order. You can start and stop the stream and await the completion of the stream, and you can
also act on promises fulfilled by each activity in the stream as it completes execution. You can also blend activities in the stream so that the machine does not stop at junctions between activities.

[useGCode](/docs/gbr/hooks/useGCode)

: You can also stream commands using &gcode. The &gcode is converted into activities, so ultimately this is the same as using the stream API, but is more convenient if you are working with &gcode.

[useTask](/docs/gbr/hooks/useTask)

: You can also start a task. A task is a pre-configured set of activities that you can start and stop. You can also await the completion of a task.

All hooks end up sending activities and commands to &gbc over the &ws interface.

### Using the &gbc &ws interface directly

You can also invoke motion primitives with the &ws interface itself.

The three possible ways to invoke motion primitives with &ws messages are:

1. Send a solo activity
1. Stream an activity
1. Start a task (containing activities)

#### Send a SoloActivity

Instead of using the useSoloActivity hook, you can compose and send a &ws message, such as:

```json
{
    "command": {
        "soloActivity": {
            "0": {
                "command": {
                    "tag": 42,
                    "activityType": 3,
                    "moveJoints": {
                        "jointPositionArray": [...]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This message will start a `moveJoints` activity against one or more of the joints in the `jointPositionArray`. For the
list of activity types, see <TypedocLink name="ACTIVITYTYPE"/>.

The `tag` property is a unique number that you can use to track progress of the activity in the &gbc status message.

The behaviour of the solo activity command is such that, if you were to issue another activity whilst the first is running, the first activity will be cancelled and second started.

The index of the solo activity (`0` in this case) has a one-to-one correspondance with your configured kinematics configurations. If you have more than
one kinematics configuration, you can start a solo activity against each one and they will run concurrently.

See <TypedocLink name="SoloActivityCommand"/> for the full list of activities you can send.

#### Stream an Activity

You can also stream an activity using a &ws message.

```json
{
    "stream": {
        "streamIndex": 0,
        "items": [
            {
                "tag": 42,
                "activityType": 3,
                "moveJoints": {
                    "jointPositionArray": [...]
                }
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

See <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/types/StreamCommand">StreamCommand</GlowsiteLink> for how to start and stop and pause a stream with the &ws API.

The key differences between using the solo activity API and streaming API are:

1. Streamed activities are queued whereas sending a new solo activity while one is running will cancel the first activity
2. Streamed motion can be blended (where one motion is blended into the next avoiding the machine stopping at junctions between motions) whereas solo activities can not be blended
3. You can await the completion of a solo activity before starting another, so that your application is in complete contrl. With streamed activities the next in the queue is executed as soon as activities complete

#### Start a task

Finally, you can start a task with a &ws message. Tasks must be pre-configured in the JSON configuration file with the activities you want to run when you start the task.

For example for a `MoveToPosition` activity within a task you can follow these steps:

1. Add a <TypedocLink name="ActivityConfig"/> entry to the `activity` section of your config file, for example:
    ```json
    {
        "activity": [
            {
                "activityType": 3,
                "moveToPosition": {
                    "kinematicsConfigurationIndex": 0,
                    "cartesianPosition": [...],
                    "moveParamsIndex": 0
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Add a <TypedocLink name="TaskConfig"/> to the `task` section of your config file, for example:
    ```json
    {
        "task": [
            {
                "name": "MyTask",
                "firstActivityIndex": 0,
                "activityCount": 1
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
3. Start the task with a <TypedocLink name="TaskCommand"/> message.
    ```json
    {
        "command": {
            "task": {
                "0": {
                    "command": {
                        "taskIndex": 0,
                        "taskCommand": 1
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

The task then executes the activity and terminates.

## Single joint motion control primitives

This is the most basic form of motion control. It allows you to control a joint in the following ways:

* Move to a position specified either relative to current position or absolutely - `moveJoints` - see <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/types/MoveJointsStream">moveJoints</GlowsiteLink>
* Move at velocity when the joint ramps up speed to a given velocity - `moveJointsAtVelocity` <GlowsiteLink to = "/docs/types/MoveJointsAtVelocityStream">MoveJointsAtVelocity</GlowsiteLink>

## Multiple joints in co-ordinated motion in 3D space

Moving in 3D cartesian

* Move in an arc - `moveArc` - see <GlowsiteLink to = "/docs/types/MoveArcStream">moveArc</GlowsiteLink>

* Move along a linear path to the target position - `moveLine` - see <GlowsiteLink to = "/docs/types/MoveLineStream">moveLine</GlowsiteLink>

* Move in a vector (straight line) along the given vector. The velocity of the motion can be controlled using moveParams. `moveVectorAtVelocity` - see <GlowsiteLink to = "/docs/types/MoveVectorAtVelocityStream">moveVectorAtVelocity</GlowsiteLink>

* Move to the target position in joint space -`moveToPosition` - see <GlowsiteLink to = "/docs/types/MoveToPositionStream">moveToPosition</GlowsiteLink>

## Cartesian space vs. Joint space

With robots and other machines with complex kinematics configurations, there is a distinction between joint space and cartesian space. Put simply, joint space is joint angles and cartesian space is x, y, z and orientation.

For a machine with cartesian kinematics (XYZ), essentially, joint space is the same as cartesian space.

For moves planned in cartesian space with cartesian space targets:

* `MoveArc`
* `MoveLine`

Moves planned in joint space with cartesian space target:

* `MoveToPosition`

Moves planning in joint space with joint space target

* `MoveJoints`
* `MoveJointsAtVelocity`
