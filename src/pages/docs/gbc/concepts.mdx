    - Frames = co-ordinate system transformation framework
    - Kinematics configuration = geometry and movement of mechanisms
    - Tasks = collection of activities
    - Activities = primitive operation on machine
    - Orientation = ways of specifying the orientation of something in 3D space
</Tldr>

&gbc especially when used to control robots, requires a basic understanding of some common concepts widely used in machine control.

Discussion of these concepts and how they are implemented in &gbc can be found here:

* Co-ordinate systems and frames - see <Link to="/docs/gbc/frames">frames</Link>
* Kinematics configurations - see <Link to="/docs/gbc/kinematics_configuration">kinematics configurations</Link>
* Tasks and Activities - see <Link to="/docs/gbc/tasks_and_activities">task and activities</Link>
* Orientation - see <Link to="/docs/gbc/orientation">orientation</Link>
