    - GBC produces periodic status mesages
    - JSON sent over WebSockets
    - Contain the current state of the machine
</Tldr>

GBC produces periodic status messages that are sent over the WebSockets connection to &gbr.

These messages provide information about the current state of the machine, activities, joints, kinematics configurations, IO and tasks.

They are obviously key in &gbr as they update front-end applications with the current status of the machine.

See, <GlowsiteLink to="/docs/types/GlowbuzzerStatus">the schema documentation for the status object</GlowsiteLink> for an overview of the contents of status mesages.
