    - Scale can be set in multiple places:
        - Drives themselves
        - Joint scale in &gbc json configuration file
        - Kinematics configuration scale in &gbc json configuration file
</Tldr>

Scaling of joints is always a thorny issue.

This is because there are multiple places scales can be set and because most drives use an integer representation for position, you have to be aware of overflows and loss of resolution.

All the scaling does is perform a series of multiplications on the number entered into a programmed move util it reaches a motor's drive.

You have to know the number of "steps per revolution" your motor+drive takes and also how the revolutions of the motor translate into linear motion on machine.

If you are using an EtherCAT drive then are three places you can apply a scale:

1. Drives themselves (set by writing SDO objects)
2. Joint scale (in the `machine.json` file loaded by &gbc):
```json
"joint": {
  "0": {
  "vmax": 201,
  "amax": 4000,
  "jmax": 80000,
  "scale": 133.33333333
}
```
3. The kinematics configuration scale (in the `machine.json` file loaded by &gbc):
```json
"cartesianParameters": {
  "linearVmax": 50,
  "linearAmax": 200,
  "linearJmax": 400,
  "scaleX": 1.2,
  "scaleY": 1.2,
  "scaleZ": 1.2,
}
```

&gbc uses a `int32_t` for the position it passes to the drive over the shared memory interface to &gbem / &gbsm.


An example to consider:

*Assumptions*
* Drive does not perform any scaling
* Drive has a 10,000 ppr encoder

We will set the scale in the &gbc `json` file in the following objects:
kinematicsConfiguration - "cartesianParameters":
* scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ = ??
"joint":
* joint scale = ??

So, if our scaling requirement is, "we put "10.000" into front-end for joint control" (for example we jog to position of a joint "10.000") we want motor to turn 1/4 of revolution".

Then, this means we want the drive to move 250 "steps" when we move to position "1" (10,000/4/10).

So, this means we want to set the joint scale to 250.

So, now we need to consider the resolution implications of our scale. If we put 0.01 into front-end we will get 0.01 x 250 = 2.5 steps.

So, 2.5 steps is 2.5/10000 of a revolution of the motor. We have to take a view if this is sufficient "resolution".

So our entry in the `json` file is:
"joint":
* joint scale = 250

The scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ parameters are used to translate the rotational movement of the joint into a cartesian distance. So this means revolutions to mm or inches.

If, for our application, 1/4 of a revolution of the motor corresponds to 100mm, then we set the scaleX, scaleY and ScaleZ to:

kinematicsConfiguration - "cartesianParameters":
* scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ = 10
