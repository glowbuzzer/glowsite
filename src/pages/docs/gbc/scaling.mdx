Scaling of joints is always a thorny issue.

This is because there are multiple places scales can be set and because most drives use a inteteger representation for position, you have to be aware of overflows and loss of resolution.

The good news is


If you are using an EtherCAT drive there are three places you can apply a scale:

1. Drives themselves
2. Joint scale
3. Kc scale

&gbc uses a `int32_t` for the position it passes to the drive

Example

drive does not scale
drive has a 10,000 ppr encoder

set scale to be

kc scale = 1
joint scale = 300


If we put "10" into fron-end we want motor to turn 1/4 of rev = 2,500

set joint scale to 250

If we put 0.01 into front-end we will get 0.01 x 250 = 2.5

So we have a "resolution of 0.004mm
