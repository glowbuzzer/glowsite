## Introduction

The tool section of the config defines the "table" of tools used by the machine.

Tools have diameters and a translation and rotation. The translation is usually used to specify the length of the tool in the form of a translation along the Z axis.

## Tips for defining Tool configs

Every machine needs to have at least one tool defined.

If you don't want to use a tool table, then just define a default tool (as index 0, the first in the json). This is the tool used for moves when you don't explicitly define a tool to use.


```json
"tool": {
  "default": {
  },
}
```

Because all values default to zero, this will create a tool with `diameter : 0`, translation `x : 0`, `y : 0`, `z : 0` and a rotation quaternion of `x : 0`, `y : 0`, `z : 0`, `w : 1` (the `w : 1` is set implicitly from an all zero quaternion).

The `diameter` parameter is just used by &gbr when building the 3D representation of the tool. It is accessible in the &gbr API for you to use in other ways.

The `translation` in `z` is used to represent a standard tool protruding from the spindle. Whether you enter a positive or negative number
for your tool lengths depends on the kinematics model for your machine. For the generic example XYZ machine we provide tools
have a negative Z translation whereas for the Staubli robot example tools have a positive Z translation.

## Example JSON

The following config defines a number of tools. The first tool, named `"Default"`, has null parameters and so has zero length and diameter and no offsets.

The second tool, named `"Tool 1"` has a length offset of 10 and a diameter or 10.

```json
  "tool": [
        {
            "name": "Default"
        },
        {
            "name": "Tool 1",
            "diameter": 10,
            "translation": {
                "z": -10
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Tool 2",
            "diameter": 10,
            "translation": {
                "z": -20
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Tool 3",
            "diameter": 10,
            "translation": {
                "z": -30
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Tool 4",
            "diameter": 10,
            "translation": {
                "z": -40
            }
        }
    ]
```
