## Introduction

The tool section of the config defines the "table" of tools used by the machine.

Tools have diameters and a translation and rotation. The translation is usually used to specify the length of the tool in the form of a translation along the Z axis.

## Tips for defining Tool configs

Every machine needs to have at least one tool defined.

If you don't want to use a tool table, then just define a default tool (as index 0, the first in the json). This is the tool used for moves when you don't explicitly define a tool to use.


```json
"tool": {
  "default": {
  },
}
```

Because all values default to zero, this will create a tool with `diameter : 0`, translation `x : 0`, `y : 0`, `z : 0` and a rotation quaternion of `x : 0`, `y : 0`, `z : 0`, `w : 1` (the `w : 1` is set implicitly from an all zero quaternion).

The `diameter` parameter is just used by &gbr when building the 3D representation of the tool. It is accessible in the &gbr API for you to use in other ways.

Usually negative `translation` in `z` is used to represent a standard tool protruding from the spindle in a negative Z direction.

## Example JSON

The following config defines three tools. The first tool, named `"default"`, has null parameters. The second tool, named `"tool1"` has a length offset of 10 and the final tool, named `"tool2"` has a length of 20.

```json
"tool": {
        "default": {
        },
        "tool1": {
            "translation": {
                "z": -10
            }
        },
        "tool2": {
            "translation": {
                "z": -20
            }
        },

    }
```
