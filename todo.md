* general review


General content / navigation
* Work on get-started/simulation page and signpost it more, as a lot of people will start here
* Some pages are too long / poor typography, eg: https://preview.glowbuzzer.com/get-started/frontend (too daunting!)
* Add "Anatomy of a GBR app" or similar to the GBR doc section. Not clear how app fits together
